        "description": "\"**Description**\n***Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis, and this opportunity could close before the application deadline. Please feel free to check in with the mentor on this.**\n\n\n\n**USFS Office/Lab and Location:** This fellowship is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the U.S. Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency's mission and motivates their work across the agency. It's been there from the agency's very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the U.S. Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** This research opportunity is at the Pacific Northwest Research Station's Corvallis Forestry Sciences Laboratory, a world-class facility on the Oregon State University campus adjacent to the OSU College of Forestry - and a nexus of forestry and research connections with a vibrant community of federal researchers and professionals from the PNW Research Station, USGS, the Siuslaw National Forest and with faculty and graduate student researchers in the College.\n\n\n\nYou will evaluate responses of west coast forest ecosystems to fires over the past 20 years, leveraging a large dataset constructed from over two decades of repeated measurements of permanent inventory plots in forest that burned. Through your analysis of this spatially balanced, statistically representative sample, you will contribute to our understanding of both immediate fire impacts, centered on tree mortality and carbon dynamics, and carbon and management-relevant aspects of post-fire trajectories. We'll also investigate post-fire trajectories to understand 1) post-fire dead wood dynamics and their implications for wildlife habitat, carbon pools, and future fire behavior; 2) post-fire forest structural and community dynamics, including describing post-fire vegetation development without active management under different pre-fire structural conditions and wildfire burn severities; and 3) early seral habitats initiated by fires of varying severity across a gradient of pre-fire stand structures. Summarizing and building models from this data across nearly 1000 forest inventory plots that span broad gradients in climate, forest type, and fire severity will allow us to generalize findings more broadly to west coast forests that have not yet burned or have burned quite recently. Collaborating with manager, practitioner and academic co-producers within this research initiative will ensure that findings inform post-fire management that can more effectively address future fire hazard, regeneration needs, habitat development and delivery of climate mitigation benefits.\n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:** Learning objectives for the project include understanding how west coast forest ecosystems and the climate benefits we count on them to deliver respond to and develop following wildfire disturbance, and exploiting the knowledge attained to guide post-fire management under actively shifting climate and fire patterns. You will also gain experience analyzing and modeling many kinds of inventory re-measurement data, gain broad perspectives on forest management through engagement with managers and practitioners, and improve communication skills and experience by sharing information developed with management, professional and scientific communities via presentations and publishing findings in journals, reports and electronically delivered visualizations.\n\n\n\n**Mentor:** The mentor for this opportunity is Jeremy Fried ([jeremy.s.fried@usda.gov](mailto:jeremy.s.fried@usda.gov)). Please contact him with any questions about this research opportunity.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: January 2024.** Start date is flexible (can be earlier, and potentially later) and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be extended upon recommendation of USFS and is contingent on the availability of funds. **Funding is currently available for two years.**\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n**Participant Stipend:** The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience, ranging from $63,000 - $77,000.\n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR).\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USFS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USFS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\n\n\n**Questions:** Please visit our [Program Website](https://orise.orau.gov/usfs/). After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email [ORISE.USFS.PNWRS@orau.org](mailto:ORISE.USFS.PNWRS@orau.org) and include the reference code for this opportunity.\"",

        "description": "\"**Biodiversity Net Gain**\nBiodiversity Net Gain is an approach to development that leaves biodiversity in a better state after the development is completed than before. Where a development has a negative impact on biodiversity it is required through The Environment Act to provide an  increase in appropriate natural habitat and ecological features over and above that has been lost.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity Net Gain can often be delivered within a development site, but where this isn't possible, an offset or compensation charge may be applied per 'biodiversity unit' that is lost, which is then used to create the 'net gain' elsewhere through the creation and enhancement of habitats, for example, new woodland, wildflower meadows or restored flood meadows. These habitats must be managed for at least 30 years.\n\n\n\nDemand for off-set sites is increasing and a market developing. Putting some of your land into a nature recovery project, such as a Habitat Bank, has many benefits including:\n\n\n\n**Contributing to nature recovery across Oxfordshire**\n\n\n\n**Improving the natural resilience of your land**\n\n\n\n**Diversifying income and spreading risk**\"",

        "description": "\"**Call**\nFair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption (HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01)\n\n**Type of action**\n\nHORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions\n\n\n\n**Topic description**\n\n\n\nExpectedOutcome:\n\n\n\nIn line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, and the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposals will support R&I to prevent and reduce food waste[\\[1\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/#fn1). They should therefore contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable food consumption, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.\n\n\n\nProjects results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:\n\n\n\n-   Reliable data on the environmental impacts related to food waste, in particular GHG emissions;\n\n-   Better understanding of the food waste prevention efforts that will accelerate EU's progress to reach climate targets and will help reduce environmental impacts (including on biodiversity) across the food supply chain;\n\n-   Integration of actions related to food waste prevention/reduction into emission reduction instruments, national energy and climate plans and other relevant EU initiatives;\n\n-   Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities.\n\n\n\nScope:\n\n\n\nClimate change and environmental degradation are recognised as the main challenges to tackle in the European Green Deal. Food waste prevention and reduction could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution reduction, better air quality, biodiversity preservation...\n\n\n\nThe 2030 climate target plan sets out to raise the EU s ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030.\n\n\n\nMember States have prepared integrated national energy and climate plans (NECPs) to achieve their 2030 targets.\n\n\n\nThe Commission brought support and expertise to Member States in the elaboration of their NECP and will continue to do so by supporting the full implementation of the plans, and prepare their update due in 2023[\\[2\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/#fn2).\n\n\n\nKey policies within the framework of the European Green Deal also include the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, and the EU zero pollution action plan.\n\n\n\nProposals should address all the following points:\n\n\n\n-   Provide reliable quantitative data for several Member States/Associated Countries on the environmental footprint of food waste, based on Life Cycle Assessments, and more specifically the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method developed by the European Commission.\n\n-   A specific focus on the following Environmental Footprint (EF) impact categories identified in the PEF method is required:\n\n    -   Climate change (main focus)\n\n    -   Land use\n\n    -   Water use\n\n    -   Resource use\n\n    -   Other relevant categories that could help assess the impacts on biodiversity.\n\n-   Combined data for the entire food supply chain but also data for each stage of the food supply chain[\\[3\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/#fn3) are expected, including a focus on sorting, storage, logistics and waste treatment. A detailed analysis for relevant food products is also expected.\n\n-   Concerning the climate change category in particular, provide estimates on the life cycle GHG emissions due to food waste. Potential double counting of avoided emissions should be analysed. If possible, these data would have to be compared to GHG reductions assumed by Member States in the NECPs - in order to enable measuring of potential impact from food waste prevention measures towards reaching the objectives of NECPs.\n\n-   Elaborate different pathways of food waste prevention/reduction interventions and assess their potential for climate change adaptation/mitigation, reduction of pollution and preservation of biodiversity. The analysis should be carried out for several types of stakeholders.\n\n-   Assess the potential for rebound effects due to food waste reduction[\\[4\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/#fn4).\n\n-   Carry out mapping activities of relevant emission reduction and funding instruments and other EU initiatives in which food waste prevention/reduction could be well integrated.\n\n-   Establish a set of recommendations on how to integrate food waste prevention/reduction in those instruments and initiatives (including NECPs).\n\n-   Implement the multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide range of food system actors (including possibly food start-ups).\n\n\n\nProposals should also build on past or ongoing research projects and ensure synergy with relevant initiatives. In particular, they should build on the work done by the Commission s Joint Research Centre in support of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste[\\[5\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/#fn5) and be aligned with the Environmental Footprint method developed by the Commission. The possible participation of the JRC in the project would consist of gathering data collected in the projects into a consistent framework for modelling food waste. It will also ensure that the proposed approach will be compatible with existing databases for the assessment of environmental impacts and aligned with the Environmental Footprint method, helping translating results into policy relevant outputs.\n\n\n\nProposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and any other relevant topic, e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, etc. Selected proposals under this topic will thus need to work together and adapt their initial work plan. Communication and dissemination activities should also be grouped and coordinated in a complementary manner.\n\n\n\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.\"",

However, CO2 capture technologies can account for a significant portion of the cost of deploying CCUS, and most of the current conventional capture technologies are suited for larger-emission sources. There is a need for RD&D of next-generation, novel CO2 capture technologies and processes that have clear advantages over the more mature versions of amine-based CO2 capture technologies in terms of cost and application to different emission sources, sizes, and CO2 concentrations. \n\n\n\n**2.2 Expected outcomes**\n\nThe CCUS RD&D Capture focus area aims to support the RD&D of next-generation CO2 capture technologies and processes that have the potential to significantly reduce capital and/or operating costs of capturing CO2 and increase applicability to different emission sources, sizes, and CO2 concentrations compared to commercially available, amine-based CO2 capture technologies.\n\n\n\nThis may be achieved through improvements in capture efficiency and/or total facility capture rate, process intensification and/or energy efficiency (i.e. reducing the energy per tonne of captured CO2), development of advanced low-cost materials and CO2 treatment technologies, reduction of waste and environmental impacts of capture technologies, etc.\n\n\n\nAs a part of the EIP, the Capture focus area under the CCUS RD&D call aims to advance clean energy and production technologies that will result in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to help Canada achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\"",

        "description": "\"**Background**  \nCareer Women's Network of Macon is an organization whose purpose is to bring together women of achievement and influence to network ideas, experience, and resources, and to solidify relationships that can enhance the image and effectiveness of women. Career Women's Network of Macon aims to provide a strong network of professional contacts. The organization promotes and encourages members to become effective and visible community leaders; it also supports continuing education and professional development of women. One of the main objectives for Career Women's Network of Macon is to acknowledge the achievements and contributions of professional women in the community.\n\n\n\nThe application process for the Career Women's Network Scholarship is also used to select recipients(s) of the Walters Family Scholarship Fund each year, which was established by bequest from Katherine Walters. A native of Macon, Georgia, Katherine Walters grew up in Macon's Cherokee Heights Neighborhood, and she attended Alexander I and Winship Elementary Schools, Lanier Junior High School, and graduated from A.L. Miller High School. Katherine attended Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville (now Georgia College and State University), completing her degree in three years. Following graduation, she attended GAB School of Commerce in Macon where she took a complete business course. In 1942 Katherine began work at Central of Georgia Railway, which is now Norfolk Southern Railway. She was proud of her 34-year career at the Railroad, working in \"a man's world\". Having a high value for education, Katherine created the Walters Family Scholarship Fund in memory of her family, and she enjoyed helping women pursue higher education through this fund.\n\n\n\n**Purpose**  \n\n\n\nSince its founding in 1980, Career Women's Network of Macon (CWN) has been committed to the education of women. Each CWN scholarship award is fulfillment of that commitment. The intent of the scholarships is to provide women an opportunity to further their education and to better prepare them for positions of leadership in the Central Georgia community.\"",

The NIH has a strong interest in the diversity of the NIH-funded workforce (see [NOT-OD-18-210](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-210.html)) and encourages institutions to diversify their populations by enhancing the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences.\n\n\n\nThe foundational [BRAIN 2025 report](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/pdf/BRAIN2025_508C.pdf) states that \"the BRAIN Initiative should be a catalyst that will drive outstanding young people to enter this area at their most creative career stage.\" The NIH diversity supplement offers an opportunity for BRAIN awardees to request additional funds to train and mentor the next generation of researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, who will contribute to advancing the goals of the BRAIN Initiative.\n\n\n\nProgram Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) of active BRAIN Initiative research program grants are encouraged to identify eligible individuals across the career development pipeline (from high school students to the faculty level) for support and scientific mentorship under the auspices of this administrative supplement. The research activities proposed in the supplement application must fall within the scope of the parent grant. Proposed career development activities should be appropriate for the career stage of the supplement candidate and should demonstrate both a strong commitment by the mentor and a clear path forward for the candidate. BRAIN Initiative PD/PIs are strongly encouraged to incorporate training activities that will help prepare the supplement candidate to conduct research relevant to the goals of the BRAIN Initiative [2025 Report](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/pdf/BRAIN2025_508C.pdf).\n\n\n\nEducational goals for the NIH component of the BRAIN Initiative (see [BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/pdf/BRAIN2025_508C.pdf)) include acquisition of quantitative skills; the appropriate use and integration of newly developed tools, technologies and methods developed under the BRAIN Initiative; and consideration of the ethical implications of neuroscience research. Special emphasis is placed on training in quantitative neuroscience (i.e., theory and statistics for biologists) and exposing physicists, engineers and statisticians to experimental neuroscience. The BRAIN 2025 Report strongly encourages scientists to cross traditional areas of expertise to conduct interdisciplinary research and emphasizes the need to leverage perspectives from quantitative disciplines (e.g., statistics, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering) to address neuroscience questions.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-FD-24-027  \nAs part of its Critical Path Initiative, FDA recognizes the need for collaborations established under the terms and conditions of a cooperative agreement, whereby existing resources and expertise can be used to the fullest extent possible. In 2009, FDA identified the Critical Path Institute (C-Path), a freestanding 501(c)(3) non-profit organization as one suitable partner in achieving its goals and awarded them a cooperative agreement to support Critical Path-related projects, mutually identified by FDA and the Critical Path Institute. FDA seeks to continue the projects that were begun and in progress under this grant. \n\n\n\nThe Critical Path Initiative is FDA's national strategy for transforming the way FDA-regulated medical products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of [FDA's Challenges and Opportunities Report](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20180125032208/https:/www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/CriticalPathOpportunitiesReports/ucm077262.htm). The publication diagnosed the reasons for the widening gap between scientific discoveries and their translation into innovative medical treatments. The report concluded that collective action was needed to modernize scientific and technical tools as well as harness information technology to evaluate and predict the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the [Critical Path Opportunities Report](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20180125075636/https:/www.fda.gov/downloads/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/CriticalPathOpportunitiesReports/UCM077258.pdf) stated, Many of the Critical Path opportunities described in this report cannot be accomplished by one entity alone. No single company, university, or governmental agency will have sufficient resources, expertise, or information base to undertake the work. We will need to develop new ways to collaborate and share data to accomplish our common goal of a robust Critical Path infrastructure . Public-Private Partnerships convened by neutral non-profit conveners are able to bring together stakeholders from government, academia, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, and industry in the pre-competitive space to address these Critical Path needs. Through nationwide collaboration with other Federal, academic, scientific, and industry organizations, the Critical Path Initiative seeks to develop new tools to facilitate innovation in FDA-regulated product development. Examples of tools include novel biomarkers, Clinical Outcome Assessment Tools, laboratory assays, genetic tests, and state-of-the art information technologies, etc. In this initiative, FDA plays the role of a facilitator in the creation of partnerships and collaborations to support specific scientific projects. \n\n\n\nAs part of its Critical Path Initiative, FDA recognizes the need for collaborations established under the terms and conditions of a cooperative agreement, whereby existing resources and expertise can be used to the fullest extent possible. In 2009, FDA identified the Critical Path Institute (C-Path), a freestanding 501(c)(3) non-profit organization as one suitable partner in achieving its goals and awarded them a cooperative agreement to support the Critical Path Initiative-related projects, mutually identified by FDA and CPath. The Critical Path Institute was awarded this cooperative agreement again in 2014 and 2019.\n\n\n\nThe applicant must demonstrate the ability to: \n\n\n\n1\\. Establish an adequate administrative and scientific infrastructure to implement all projects under this collaborative effort\n\n\n\n2\\. Identify and/or hire sufficient number of qualified personnel to conduct the necessary research and project-manage all related activities, including review of project milestones for degree of completion, preparation/reporting of project findings, periodic and final reports, all for approval by FDA, and for subsequent distribution in the public domain\n\n\n\n3\\. In conjunction with FDA, develop plans for the conduct of identified research projects\n\n\n\n4\\. Identify and/or build, and effectively leverage databases and other facilities and/or resources for the conduct of identified projects\n\n\n\n5\\. Upon completion of a given project, propose related studies/projects, if needed, to build on the findings of the project and continue to leverage established resources and personnel. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate the capability to address regulatory science issues that define FDA's public health mission and priorities\n\n\n\n6\\. Ability to coordinate a sustainability plan to obtain funding to maintain the core grant functions as well as a plan for the individual consortia/AIMs until the objectives and goals are met. \n\n\n\n7\\. The applicant must also provide an assurance that it will not accept funding for a Critical Path Public-Private Partnership project from any organization that manufactures or distributes products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration unless it provides assurances in its agreement with the Food and Drug Administration that the results of the Critical Path Public-Private Partnership project will not be influenced by any source of funding. \n\n\n\n8\\. Plan for data sharing\n\n\n\nThis cooperative agreement (CA) is to continue to maintain and manage existing consortia groups convened and established by the Critical Path Institute and the AIMs listed below:\n\n\n\nAIMS:\n\n\n\n1\\. Rare Disease Cures Accelerator Data Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP)\n\n\n\n2\\. CURE Drug Repurposing Collaboratory (CDRC)\n\n\n\n3\\. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Working Group and AKI Data Acquisition\n\n\n\n4\\. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) Pre-Consortium\n\n\n\n5\\. Lysosomal Diseases (LD) Pre-Consortium\n\n\n\n6\\. Critical Path for Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases (CP-RND)\n\n\n\n***AIM Descriptions and Goals/Objectives:***\n\n\n\n1\\. Rare Disease Cures Accelerator Data Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP)\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nThe Rare Disease Cures Accelerator-Data and Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP) was established in 2019 to provide a centralized and standardized infrastructure to support data-sharing and accelerate rare disease characterization, with the goal of accelerating the development of treatments and cures for rare diseases.\n\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n-  RDCA-DAP promotes the sharing of existing patient-level data and encourages the standardization of new data collection. By integrating such data in a regulatory-grade format suitable for analytics, RDCA-DAP accelerates the understanding of disease progression (including sources of variability to optimize the characterization of subpopulations), clinical outcome measures and biomarkers, and facilitates the development of mathematical models of disease and innovative clinical trial designs.\n\n-  RDCA-DAP is positioned to generate solutions to drug development bottlenecks. As such, the utility of the patient-level data is maximized, and data may be used to develop tools that will be accessible to the community in order to optimize and accelerate drug development across rare diseases. \n\n\n\n2\\. CURE Drug Repurposing Collaboratory (CDRC)\n\n\n\nDescription: \n\n\n\nCURE Drug Repurposing Collaboratory (CDRC) is a public private partnership to advance the collection of real-world data (RWD) to generate real-world evidence (RWE) that can inform drug repurposing for areas of high unmet medical need. CDRC uses the CURE ID platform which is an FDA-NCATS collaboration that allows the global clinical community to report novel uses of existing drugs to treat diseases through a website, a smartphone, or other mobile device. The repository captures the clinical outcomes when drugs are used for new indications, in new populations, in new doses, or in new combinations.\n\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n\n\n-  Leverage the Collaboratory across multiple therapeutic areas to evaluate the efficacy of existing drugs for new indications using multiple data sources, including real-world data\n\n-  Target emerging/reemerging infectious diseases, anti-microbial drug- resistant infections, neglected infectious diseases, diseases in pediatric populations and pregnant women, as well as rare diseases including oncology, where there is little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs\n\n-  Evaluate drug leads through advanced analytics to identify candidates for repurposing as new treatments in a transparent, open forum\n\n-  Inform the design of clinical trials of already marketed drugs for new indications\n\n-  Generate real-world evidence to update and inform existing disease treatment guidelines and expanding drug labels\n\n-  Develop a regulatory roadmap to advance drug repurposing through drug relabeling paths to expedite the availability of safe and effective treatments for diseases with limited or no treatment options\n\n\n\n3\\. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Working Group and AKI Data Acquisition\n\n\n\nDescription: The Acute Kidney Injury Working Group (AKI WG) was established to optimize the collection of translational biomarker data to develop better predictive tools for kidney toxicity. The AKI WG has brought together key stakeholder groups in nephrology and the AKI patient community, thereby enabling evaluation of unmet needs in drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI), opportunities for collaboration, and identification of possible solutions for DIKI and data sharing.\n\n\n\nObjectives: The overarching objective is to transform translational kidney safety approaches to accelerate drug development across therapeutic areas and improve patient safety during clinical trials.\n\n\n\n-  Complete and implement the action plan for development of predictive tools for use in clinical trials of novel therapies, which will feed into, synergize with, and support current and future efforts to develop tools that are needed to advance drug development for the treatment and prevention of AKI.\n\n-  Acquire additional clinical and nonclinical data on biomarkers of kidney injury for the Biomarker Data Repository (BmDR)\n\n\n\n4\\. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) Pre-Consortium\n\n\n\nDescription: The rare disease alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and increased mortality, as well as hepatic disease which in the most severe cases may lead to cirrhosis, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and ultimately, the need for liver transplantation. The only FDA-approved products for AATD-related lung disease are augmentation therapies manufactured from human plasma. Studies suggest that augmentation therapy may slow decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and slow decline in lung density. In addition, some data suggest that a lower rate of loss of lung tissue as measured by computed tomography (CT) lung density correlates with lower mortality and need for lung transplant; however, the available studies are inconclusive. There are no approved drugs for hepatic disease. \n\n\n\nA public-private partnership consortium launched in 2023, focused on aggregating available clinical trial data and other studies to evaluate the longitudinal performance of biomarkers, including CT lung density, and clinical measures in AATD for potential use as endpoints or surrogate endpoints to evaluate future therapies for AATD. There is an unmet need for non-invasive means to identify, stage, and monitor Pi*ZZ genotype patients at risk or who have developed hepatic disease.\n\n\n\nObjectives: The overarching objective of this research is to progress drug development tools to provide a pathway for evaluating novel therapies for AATD.\n\n\n\nThe near-term objectives are as follows:\n\n\n\n-  Advance the activities of the AATD consortium to serve as a platform to aggregate data from available clinical trials, registries, and other studies to assess longitudinal dynamics of biomarkers, clinical measures, or other clinically meaningful metrics specific to AATD.\n\n-  Develop tools that can have the potential to optimize enrollment and inform clinical trial design.\n\n-  Develop preliminary versions of clinical trial endpoints, including clinical outcomes and potential surrogate endpoints, that can be incorporated into future drug development programs\n\n\n\n5\\. Lysosomal Diseases (LD) Consortium\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nThe Critical Path for Lysosomal Diseases (CPLD) Consortium is a consortium that was launched September 2023. It brings together multiple experts in lysosomal diseases (LDs) including academic researchers, medical product developers, patient communities and advocacy organizations, and regulators to generate actionable solutions to accelerate drug development for lysosomal diseases.\n\n\n\nGoals/Objectives:\n\n\n\n-  Create a solutions-focused workstream for CPLD focusing on various cross-cutting solutions for unmet needs common across multiple LDs.\n\n-  Aggregate and integrate patient-level data for the development of tools, methods, and processes to characterize the disease pathology and natural history, identify drug targets, increase efficiency, predictability, and productivity of clinical development of therapies\n\n-  Convene public meetings focused on addressing various aspects of unmet needs and proposed solutions for lysosomal drug development\n\n\n\n6\\. Critical Path for Rare Neurodegenerative Diseases (CP-RND)\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nThe Critical Path for Rare Neurodegenerative Disease (CP-RND) public-private partnership (PPP) launched September 2022. It brings together multiple experts in rare neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, as well as private entities, patient communities and advocacy organizations to accelerate and advance understanding of disease pathology, treatment options, diagnostics, and drug development\n\n\n\nObjectives: \n\n\n\n-  Advance regulatory science and scientific research to support and accelerate the development of drugs for patients with ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases by providing an integrated environment for scientific discoveries to address tangible knowledge gaps that accelerates translation from bench to bedside\n\n-  Aggregate and integrate patient-level data for the development of tools, methods, and processes to characterize the disease pathology and natural history, identify drug targets, increase efficiency, predictability, and productivity of clinical development of therapies, including advancement of therapeutic development and establishment of clinical trial networks\n\n-  Accelerate the development of treatments for ALS by establishing partnerships, consortia, and collaboration with other public and private entities, patient-advocacy groups and individuals in ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases \n\n\n\nThe Grantee is expected to function independently but is encouraged to network with other organizations when possible or when it will improve the project outcomes.\n\n\n\nTo be successful, an applicant must satisfy the criteria set out in Section 566 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and content described in the Review Criteria within this NOFO. \n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** DE-FOA-0003219  \nThe purpose of this FOA is to accelerate decarbonization across the industrial sector and advance the Biden Administration's goal to \"deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050\". This FOA focuses on subsector-specific decarbonization approaches for the highest emitting and most challenging to address industrial subsectors. The Energy and Emissions Intensive Industries (EEII) program within IEDO focuses on improving efficiency and decarbonizing industries with the largest energy use and GHG emissions (i.e. chemicals and refining, iron and steel, cement and concrete, forest and paper products, food and beverage, and other industries such as glass and aluminum).\n\n\n\n**Topic Area 1: Decarbonizing Chemicals & Fuels**\n\n\n\nTopic 1 Background and Opportunity: The chemicals industry is a critical element of the U.S. economy, contributing over 25% of the U.S. gross domestic product and exporting $179 billion of goods. It is responsible for converting raw materials into more than 70,000 diverse products, which are essential to several sectors of the U.S. economy, including agriculture, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and energy. As the industry transforms to achieve decarbonization, there is a unique opportunity to realize broader sustainability and efficiency improvements across the chemicals industry.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 1 - Advanced Process Technologies to Convert Sustainable Feedstocks to Hydrocarbon Chemicals & Fuels:** This area of interest seeks to advance scalable pathways to produce high-volume chemicals and fuels starting from non-fossil-based sources of carbon.\n\n\n\nApplications should address the high volume, energy intensive, high greenhouse gas emitting chemicals including petrochemicals (NAICS 325110), basic organic chemicals (NAICS 325199), ethanol (NAICS 325193), and plastics materials and resins (NAICS 325211), and others. Applications must aim to address chemicals with a current U.S. production volume >0.5 MMT or justify the ability for the technology to have broader decarbonization potential within the chemicals sector.11 Additional interests include chemicals (e.g., ethanol, methanol) that have value as a fuel or can be used as precursors for existing hard-to-electrify fuels like aviation, shipping, long-haul trucking.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 2 - Advanced Processes for Production of Non-hydrocarbon Products**: This area of interest seeks applications for innovative, low-carbon/low energy production of non-hydrocarbon chemical products including advanced technologies for production of inorganic chemicals (NAICS 325180), industrial gases (NAICS 325120), nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers (NAICS 325311), and others.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 3   Chemicals Value Chain Decarbonization**: This area of interest seeks integration of efficiency and decarbonization benefits across chemical value chains. Research under this subtopic will advance technology to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and de-risk low-carbon fuel and product supply chains.\n\n\n\n**Topic Area 2: Decarbonizing Iron and Steel**\n\n\n\n**Topic 2 Background and Opportunity**: Steel is a vital material for many economic sectors.  It is used for automotive and other transportation applications, homes, commercial buildings, and industrial equipment, as well as many other applications in everyday life. The U.S. steel industry produced about 81 million tonnes of crude steel in 2022, consuming 0.8 quads of energy. The U.S. steel industry is among the best globally in terms of GHG emissions per tonne of product 12 because of the high fraction of remelted scrap in steel production compared to other nations. To achieve even deeper decarbonization in the U.S., steel manufacturers will require new strategies to decarbonize ironmaking from virgin ore, to improve the ore quality cost-effectively, and to reverse the accumulation of copper contamination in steel scrap to improve steel recycling rates.  Also, there is an opportunity to minimize carbon consumption in steelmaking, the last step of refining scrap and ore-based metallics into quality steel.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 1-Alternative Iron Making**: The most intensive source of CO2 emissions in the iron and steel industry is the ironmaking process in the blast furnace, where iron oxide is transformed to high carbon molten iron using metallurgical coke. To decarbonize this subsector, replacing blast furnace production with a process that uses a low carbon alternative reductant is needed.  Examples include hydrogen (including plasma hydrogen), electrolysis, sodium, green ammonia, or other alternative elements or compounds that are available in relevant commercial quantities without a large carbon footprint. The application must provide supporting evidence that the process is rationally scalable to a production plant that could produce a minimum of 2 million tonnes of iron per year. The supporting evidence must show that the process is CAPEX-competitive: the production plant should have a pathway to cost less than $1.5B in capital equipment\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 2 - Ore improvement:** Direct reduced iron requires a higher quality of iron ore than is typically used in a blast furnace because DRI is primarily used in arc furnace melting where excessive gangue (non-ferrous mineral matter within the material) reduces productivity and can result in operational challenges. This AOI seeks to enable broader applicability of DRI by developing innovative, cost-effective processes to improve ore quality, including the use of advanced separations enabled by low-energy crushing and grinding. Currently, approximately only 3% of global seaborne iron ore supply is of DR quality and an estimated additional 59 Mt of global DRI capacity is expected to be online by 203014.  Therefore, it is anticipated that DR grade iron ore supplies will continue to be greatly constrained. Applications with innovative approaches should explain why the proposed method is not currently being used now, and what key technical challenges must be overcome to put the improvements into practice.  Blast furnace grade ore (<65% iron) must be cost-competitively processed to DRI grade ore (>67% iron), on a gangue removal basis.\n\nApplications must provide supporting documentation justifying that the estimated processing costs would provide sufficient value for the increased metallics concentration and include supportable estimates for reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption.\n\n\n\nThis AOI seeks Tier 1 or Tier 2 proposals.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 3-Improving steel recyclability through reducing tramp metal contaminants**: This AOI seeks to fund technologies that minimize or eliminate problematic tramp elements in steel scrap (primarily copper, but also tin and others) either in recycling stages or during steelmaking. Steel production from remelted scrap does not remove copper that is in solution in the metal, and it also accumulates additional copper that is co-mingled with steel scrap (for example, copper wire or bronze components).  As a result, the average level of copper in steel scrap has increased steadily over the last 70 years.\n\n\n\n**Area of Interest 4-Low-carbon steelmaking**: This topic would fund low carbon steelmaking technologies and practices to reduce GHG emissions in traditional arc furnace steelmaking, or reduce carbon emissions via alternative steelmaking processes. Arc furnace steelmaking currently relies on significant quantities of carbon (a) intrinsic to metallic charge (in pig iron and direct reduced iron, for example) and (b) otherwise injected. The additional energy that carbon supplies serves to melt the steel charge faster than with arc heating alone (carbon burning off as CO2).  Additionally, when carbon reacts with oxygen and becomes gas, this assists nitrogen removal while the resulting foaming forms a protective slag layer that shields the refractory furnace lining from the otherwise damaging high intensity electric arc.  The elevated carbon levels in the bath are then adjusted (again, by oxidizing the carbon to CO2) to a target level before tapping, optional ladle refining, and casting.\n\n\n\n**Topic Area 3: Decarbonizing Food and Beverage Products**\n\n\n\nTopic 3 Background and Opportunity: The food and beverage (F&B) industry is a critical component of the U.S. economy. In 2021, the F&B manufacturing sector produced and shipped products with a value of nearly $1.1 trillion and employed approximately 1.7 million workers.17 The sector accounted for an estimated 1,935 TBtu of energy (10% of total energy use for U.S. manufacturing) and 96 MMT CO2e of GHG emissions (10% of total energy-related GHG emissions for U.S. manufacturing) in 2018.18 The F&B industry produces a wide spectrum of products that are both consumed domestically and exported to international markets. Key industry segments include grain and oilseed milling, animal slaughtering and processing, fruit and vegetable processing, dairy product operations, baking and snacks, sugar manufacturing, beverage manufacturing, and others.\"",

This year's competitions took place at 21 participating ACM SIG conferences, sponsored by SIGACCESS, SIGAPP,  SIGARCH, SIGBED, SIGCHI, SIGCOMM, SIGCSE, SIGDA,SIGDOC, SIGGRAPH, SIGHPC, SIGMETRICS, SIGMICRO, SIGMOBILE, SIGOPS, SIGPLAN, SIGSOFT and SIGSPATIAL as well as TAPIA which included more than 323 student participants. The SRC program is administered by Nanette Hernandez of the ACM, Douglas Baldwin of SUNY Geneseo and Adrienne Decker of University at Buffalo.\n\n\n\n**Program Overview**\n\n\n\nThe ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research at well-known ACM sponsored and co-sponsored conferences before a panel of judges and attendees.\n\n\n\nThe SRC program is administered by Nanette Hernandez of the ACM, Douglas Baldwin of SUNY Geneseo and Adrienne Decker of University at Buffalo.\n\n\n\nThere are two rounds of competition at each conference hosting an SRC and a grand finals competition:\n\n\n\n**First Round Competitions**\n\n\n\nThe first round is usually referred to as the Poster Session. This is your opportunity to present your research in the areas specified in the conference's first Call for Submissions. Judges will review the posters and speak to participants about their research; a group of semi-finalists will be chosen to present at the second round of the competition.\n\n\n\n**Second Round Competitions**\n\n\n\nSemi-finalists continue by giving a short presentation of their research before a panel of judges, with a supporting power point presentation. Evaluations are based on the presenter s knowledge of his/her research area, contribution of the research, and the quality of the oral and visual presentation. Three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate (Masters or PhD program), receiving $500, $300, and $200, respectively.\n\n\n\n**The SRC Grand Finals**\n\n\n\nFirst place undergraduate and graduate (Masters or PhD program) student winners from the SRCs held during the year advance to the SRC Grand Finals. A different panel of judges evaluates these winners against each other via the web. Three undergraduates and three graduates will be chosen as the SRC Grand Finalists.\n\n\n\n**Judging**\n\n\n\nJudges will include professional computer scientists attending the conference activities. Each student will be evaluated by a minimum of three faculty members, none of whom are affiliated with the student's university.\"",

SDN increases the flexibility of networks, providing greater control of network behavior, performance, monitoring and problem diagnosis. SDN is thus one of the essential technologies for ensuring robust,flexibleand high performing wired and wireless beyond 5G/6G networks. The first generation of SDN focused primarily on the implications of control and data plane separation, and control plane programmability. Today the networking research community focus also includes the second generation of SDN - data plane programmability - as enabled at transmission line rates through the relatively recent introduction of programmable layer 2/3 switches, programmable Network Interface Cards (NICs), and increasingly flexible physical layer transmission technologies such as software defined radios and optical transceivers. This program focuses on enabling flexible and scalable programmable networks for next generation core and beyond 5G/6G networks. This calls for creative and innovative ways of approaching the associated challenges and experimental demonstration and verification on research testbeds where appropriate. This program seeks joint Japanese-US research projects that leverage each nation's expertise and address the following topic areas:\n\n-Network architectures/In-network intelligence and programmable network functionality\n\nDevelop the foundationsfornext-generation programmable functionality for enhanced core, optical and beyond 5G/6G networks\n\n\n\n-Smart services, applications,and experimentation on research testbeds\n\nDevelop experimental demonstrations of novel future services and essential networking applications on campus, Japan and/or US testbeds\"",

        "title": "\"Food Security - Invitation for Funding Local Solutions Advancing Food Justice",
        "description": " HealthAt the Stupski Foundation, we believe that dignified, nutritious, equitably produced, and culturally relevant food is a fundamental right. Through this funding invitation, the Foundation seeks to strengthen existing community-based organizations and coalitions working to advance just, healthy, and equitable food systems. For decades, communities of color and people living in low-income ZIP codes have faced racial, economic, health, and environmental disparities linked to underlying factors including the rising costs of living, inequitable access to employment and affordable housing, and historic disinvestment. While responses to immediate food security needs are crucial, we seek to bolster efforts that focus on long-term, multigenerational transformation; address the systemic root causes of food insecurity; and build a thriving future beyond the current crisis.\n\n\n\nEligible organizations may work across an intersection of issues, with established priorities that include healthy food systems, food justice, and food sovereignty. While food justice does not need to be the exclusive mission of applying organizations, it should be a central part of their work. Organizations must be committed to an assets-based approach (uplifting community knowledge, wisdom, strengths) rather than a focus on deficits. We value the lived experiences of communities of color and share the belief that these viewpoints and skills are essential to long-term transformation of food systems. Additionally, we encourage organizations whose work includes at least one or more of the following approaches to apply:\n\n\n\n-    Community Leadership Development-Organizations are informed and led by the communities they serve and where they live, work, and play. They build power and capacity among local residents, frontline community leaders, and stakeholders. \n\n-    Healthy Local Economies Organizations strengthen community-directed land and food infrastructure to support healthy, local, culturally relevant food access and spur economic opportunities and/or neighborhood and community ownership (e.g., worker-owned cooperatives, healthy food social enterprise). Proposals can include support for infrastructure (e.g., land, healthy foods processing facilities).\n\n-    Health and Well-being Organizations prioritize improvements in individual and collective wellness (mental, physical, emotional, identity) and access to nutritious and culturally relevant foods. \n\n-    Policy and Advocacy Organizations advance policy and advocacy or grow community engagement and leadership capacity related to policy and advocacy in healthy food access, food justice and sovereignty, and food as medicine.\n\n-    Just Transition Organizations work to transform food and agricultural systems from the current extractive economic model toward models that foster community ownership, care for the land and water, and thriving local economies.\n\n-    Arts and Culture Organizations integrate arts and culture as a tool for advancing long-term food security, food justice, and/or food sovereignty.\n\n-    Asset-Based Metrics Organizations focus on outcomes related to community resilience, ownership, health, and/or sustainability.\"",

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** W911NF24S0005  \nThis Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Foundational Science Research Unit (FSRU) of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) solicits new proposals for its fiscal year 2025 program of basic research in behavioral science. It is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) and 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement through the competitive selection of proposals and 10 U.S.C. 4001, 10 U.S.C. 4021, and 10 U.S.C. 4022.\n\n\n\nTo meet the operational objectives of the U.S. Army over the next two decades, the Army must improve its capability to acquire, develop, employ, and retain Soldiers and leaders who can individually and as part of a group:\n\n\n\nPrepare for and adapt quickly to dynamic missions, unpredictable operational environments, and a wide spectrum of contexts;\n\n\n\nEffectively function autonomously and as part of larger systems in complex, information-rich environments;\n\n\n\nPerform in extended, hybrid, and continuous operations;\n\n\n\nInteract and collaborate effectively in joint-service and multi-national operations.\n\n\n\nARI requests proposals to conduct basic research that will provide a scientific foundation to support these broad capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe Basic Research program focuses on three strategic areas for advancing personnel science.\n\n\n\n1\\. Science of Measurement of Individuals and Collectives: Advanced psychometric theory for deriving valid measurements from complex assessments and continuous streams of data\n\n\n\n2\\. Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics: Multilevel theory and methods for understanding dynamic restructuring, coordination, and composition processes in teams and complex organizations\n\n\n\n3\\. Formal/Informal Learning and Development: Holistic models of individual and collective learning and development across work settings and contexts throughout the career span\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for an award under this announcement, a potential awardee must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources and responsibility, ability to comply with the performance schedule, past performance, integrity, experience, technical capabilities, operational controls, and facilities. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense and Army policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the Army.\n\n\n\n**Types of Proposals** \n\nThe funding opportunity is divided into three types of proposals for basic research: (1) Standard Basic Research proposals and (2) Targeted Opportunities which encompass: a) Early Career Proposals (ECP) and, b) Short-Term Innovative Research (STIR) Proposals (both of which are for basic research also). ARI will accept all three types in response to this BAA.\n\n\n\n*1. Standard Proposals*. Most basic research awards are awarded in response to Standard Proposals provided by Applicants with experienced researchers. In recent years, the most typical period of performance has been for three years, and the mean award total has been approximately $750,000. Standard Proposals may be formulated as either a complete effort or as a base effort plus option(s) that may be exercised by ARI, if initial results are promising.\n\n*2. Army Research Institute Targeted Opportunities* \n\n*a. Early Career Proposals*. To foster the development of innovative and creative researchers, ARI solicits proposals with primary investigators who are early in their research careers and have never received ARI funding as a Principal Investigator. All ARI evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate Early Career Proposals, except the criteria that address the experience of the Principal Investigator (see SECTION II. E) of this BAA for evaluation criteria). In all other respects, the evaluation criteria used in this BAA apply equally to both Standard and Early Career proposals. While there is no specific amount of funding set aside for these proposals, initial budgets should be modest: approximately $110K for the initial year. To be considered for the Early Career category:\n\ni. An Investigator must specify in the Proposal Abstract and on the proposal cover page that they are requesting consideration under this funding category.\n\nii. Projects should be designed for one year of funding. Note that optional periods of research (one to two additional years) may be included in the proposal and may be funded should the initial work prove promising. These years should be denoted as option years in the proposal.\n\niii. The research must fit at least one of the stated three (3) domains of the BAA Basic Research areas of interest.\n\niv. The Principal Investigator must have received their Ph.D. within five years of the time of proposal submission, and not previously received funding from ARI as a Principal Investigator.\n\n\n\n*b. Short-Term Innovative Research (STIR) Proposals*. The objectives of the STIR awards are to support rapid, short-term investigations to assess the merit of innovative new concepts in basic research. STIR awards provide an excellent opportunity to showcase new concepts and explore new areas in basic research. STIR awards are aimed at shaping new directions in research and the sciences. To be considered for a Short-Term Innovative Research Award:\n\ni. An Investigator must specify in the Proposal Abstract and on the proposal cover page that they are requesting consideration under this funding category.\n\nii. Projects should be designed for one year of funding.\n\niii. The research must fit at least one of the stated three (3) domains of the BAA Basic Research areas of interest.\n\niv. Proposals in the amount of $60,000 or less are sought for STIR awards.\n\nv. Capital equipment cannot be purchased under a STIR Program award.\n\nvi. Report preparation costs must not exceed $100.\n\nvii. A fee is not permitted under STIR Program awards as they are awarded as grants.\n\nviii. Due to the relatively small dollar amount and short-term nature of these awards, applicants are encouraged to maximize the benefit derived from this funding by prioritizing labor and employing other cost-saving measures in support of the STIR program effort.\n\n\n\n*General Guidelines for All Proposals*. Both single-investigator and collaborative research efforts are encouraged. Multidisciplinary approaches are especially encouraged to the extent that the proposal reflects the theories, models, and approaches of multiple disciplines, combined creatively to address the research problem.\n\nCollaborative efforts may involve researchers either at a single institution or in cooperating institutions. Highly innovative proposals addressing high-risk, high-reward topics are also strongly encouraged and should include strong methodology and other risk-mitigation strategies. Theory development and/or meta-analyses that address theoretical issues in ARI research interest domains will also be considered. The use of military participants is neither necessary nor encouraged, and ARI is unlikely to arrange access to military participants to support basic research investigations.\n\n\n\n**Basic Research Topic Areas of Interest** \n\nBasic research is effort directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1 and Research Category 6.1). Basic Research is systematic study directed toward a fuller knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and or observable facts. Basic research aims for broad impact rather than to develop specific processes or produce for targeted applications. The ARI Foundational Science Research Unit (FSRU) manages the Basic Research Program and maintains close contact with ARI's applied scientists and other relevant agencies within the Army. These contacts help define issues that require fundamental research, ensure that the basic research program is coordinated across Services (Department of Defense), and facilitate the transition of basic research results to applied programs for eventual use by the operational Army.\n\n\n\nAll proposals will be considered; however, ARI has identified the following three (3) domains as particularly germane to its basic research needs. This list is neither comprehensive nor exclusive and ARI is especially open to proposals that combine or cut across these domains. These domains are:\n\n1. Science of Measurement of Individuals and Collectives\n\n2. Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics\n\n3. Formal and Informal Learning and Development \n\nAn in-depth description of each domain follows. For additional information on these domains, and potential areas of interest, Applicants may also consult the following reports by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Science (Available at http://www.nap.edu):\n\n-      \"Measuring Human Capabilities: An Agenda for Basic Research on the Assessment of Individual and Group Performance Potential for Military Accession\" (2015) supervised by the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences\n\n-       The Context of Military Environments: Social and Organizational Factors  (2014) supervised by the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences\n\n-       Sociocultural Data to Accomplish Department of Defense Missions: Toward a Unified Social Framework: Workshop Summary  (2011) supervised by the Board on Human-System Integration \n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions of these three broad research domains are provided below. Each domain description includes: (a) a broad overview of the relevant Army problems and goal of the research domain, (b) the primary research objective, (c) a list of sub-objectives, and (d) high-priority research questions.\n\n\n\n**1. Science of Measurement of Individuals and Collectives** \n\nThe success of the U.S. Army can be largely attributed to the selection, assignment, development, and retention of highly skilled and exceptional Soldiers. To fulfill the Army People Strategy and modernization priorities for the Army and ensure continued success, the U.S. Army needs to place the right Soldier, in the right job, at the right time. To do so, the U.S. Army must continuously identify and refine the core knowledge, skills, and behaviors (KSBs) critical to Soldier success, both across the U.S. Army as a whole and within specific military occupational specialties (MOS), while also improving the ability to understand and assess Soldier effectiveness and performance.\n\nTraditional personnel tests were designed to capture broad, diffuse constructs (e.g., cognitive ability, personality, vocational aptitudes) that aggregate individual experiences over long periods of time often in mass-testing settings (e.g., annual performance, initial training, and career continuance). More recent technological advances afford observing and recording human behavior at increasingly finer-grained scales of resolution (e.g., real-time GPS coordinates, physiological sensors). Extracting meaningful psychological conclusions from such fine-grained observations has proved challenging, at least with respect to the psychometric models from which traditional personnel tests were developed.\n\nPsychometric models and methods have advanced greatly since the advent of traditional personnel tests. Lagging, however, is adapting and refining such models and methods to better understand human behavior in organizations, particularly with respect to performance in the massively hierarchical, interdependent, and constantly fluid social situations of the environment the military operates in. Such environments are not well-represented by broad, diffuse aggregates (e.g., a single standardized test score). What are needed now, more than ever, are psychometric models and methods for quantifying meaningful patterns of human behaviors in complex social situations.\n\n\n\n**Strategic Goal**. The primary goal for the Basic Research program within the Science of Measurement of Individuals and Collectives domain is to fundamentally improve psychological testing and measurement by deriving means to assess multiple constructs and increasing overall precision, understanding, and prediction of individual and collective behavior and performance. The Research Objectives of this area are:\n\n-      Psychometric Theory \n\n    -     Novel test theory and psychometric quantities beyond those of classical (e.g., reliability, validity) and modern (e.g., item and test information) test theory \n\n    -     Testing models that address variability in trait/ability expression and observed score variance (e.g., test context, test-taker motivation, or test-taker perspective) \n\n    -     New or refined theory related to the use of emerging technologies and algorithms (e.g., machine learning, generative AI, natural language processing) in psychological testing and measurement o Research on psychometric theory that incorporates interdisciplinary views (e.g., engineering, computer science, applied statistics)\n\n-      Novel Predictors & Criterion \n\n    -     New and refined predictors and criterion constructs, including innovative research on the criterion space \n\n    -    Investigations of how constructs of interest vary across levels, situational contexts, and temporal scopes \n\n    -     Research on potential interactions between constructs and how context can impact the strength of these interactions\n\n-      Improving Assessment Methods\n\n    -     Measurement approaches and methods for unobtrusively and efficiently observing and measuring social and behavioral processes \n\n    -     Innovative methods for extracting psychologically meaningful patterns from archival and high dimensional behavioral data \n\n    -     New and refined theory related to fairness and bias in assessment \n\n    -     Theoretical and methodological advancements on the use of emerging technologies (e.g., sensors and wearable technology) and novel data sources in basic research\n\n-      Time & Dynamic Relationships \n\n    -     Novel methods and analytic techniques for modeling change overtime \n\n    -     Theories that explain dynamic processes and phenomenon that incorporate both inter- and intra-individual change, including performance theories that incorporate behavioral variability across time \n\n    -     Measurement theory and novel construct validation models and methods that explicitly incorporate time \n\n    -     Research that incorporates diverse conceptualizations of time (e.g., observed, latent, discrete, continuous) and interdisciplinary perspectives on modeling time (e.g., stationary time series, state-space models) \n\n\n\n**High Priority Research Questions**\n\n1. How can we expand our understanding of the criterion space? What assessment methodology and testing models can be developed to better predict performance and effectiveness in modern organizations?\n\n2. How can traditional and novel psychometric methods be integrated and combined to improve the testing development and construct validation process? What are the benefits and weaknesses of novel psychometric models and methods as compared to traditional testing methods?\n\n3. How can emerging technologies and AI facilitated methods be used to enhance performance assessment and improve data scope and granularity? What novel methods can be developed, or existing methods be adapted, to extract meaningful patterns from high dimensional behavioral data?\n\n1. How do individuals experience and perceive change in their affective, cognitive, and behavioral experiences over time? How can between- and within-individual change be modeled in meaningful and predictive ways?\n\n\n\n**2. Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics**\n\nThe Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics research focal area looks at the effects of grouping and network membership. For the Basic Research Program, the specific scientific needs differ when the aperture is focused at the team and small group level than on the larger systems and multi-systems levels. As such, this research focal area is comprised of two sub-areas, Teams and Small Groups, and Organizations and Systems, but proposals that address both levels are welcome and encouraged.\n\nTeams and Small Groups Teams and small groups are the core element of the Army's organizational structure. Historically, mission success has been contingent on many individual squads  independent but coordinated contributions. While this important role will continue, evolving contexts and conditions will change how teams are composed, managed, and evaluated. In the future, teams will likely be more heterogeneous in composition with members representing varied capabilities, perhaps from different commands or even services. As technology progresses, some traditional team member functions may be allocated to non-human team members. In an uncertain future operating space, teams may need to be rapidly assembled or reconstituted.\n\nStrategic Goal. The primary objective within the Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics domain at the Teams and Small Groups level, is to further science to support team assignment, development, and optimization reflective of emerging requirements and characteristics of teams. The Research Objectives of this area are:\n\n-      Advanced Composition \n\n    -    Novel multi-trait models of team functioning that are better predictive of team performance and capability of compensatory groupings \n\n    -     Systems models of composition that optimize personnel distribution to yield many good teams within multi-echelon organizations and/or multi-team systems\n\n-      Team Formation and Development \n\n    -     New theories on team formation and maintenance processes, with an emphasis on ad hoc and rapidly-formed teams \n\n    -    New models on personnel modularity in team efficacy and performance \n\n    -     Research on collective training versus training focused on the individual, and preparation of teams and small groups\n\n-      Dyadic and Sub-team Performance:\n\n    -     New means to measure, model, and represent team constructs such as shared mental models, collective efficacy, team-specific culture, identity, and trust at the collective and individual contribution levels \n\n    -     Methods to study collaboration and interaction between teams in shared and distributed environments\n\n\n\n**High Priority Research Questions**\n\n1. What are the mechanisms and developmental trajectories of rapidly formed and ad hoc teams and what conditions and approaches best optimize this process? What are the determinants of team success over time? What is the relative importance of composition, continuity of membership, leader behaviors, external support / intervention?\n\n2. How can we better understand how teams concurrently operate in and interact with multiple physical and non-physical domains of operation (e.g., immediate surroundings, distributed forces, cyber)?\n\n3. How can trust be reinforced, repaired, or sustained among team members after the initial emergence of trust decisions and following interactions over time and changes in team composition and structure, and how does this influence team process and performance outcomes?\n\n4. How do team culture and identity influence team goals and outcomes?\n\n\n\n**Organizations and Systems** \n\nThe U.S. Army is a very large organization with approximately 450,000 active-duty, 200,000 reservist, and 325,000 National Guard personnel, and also more than 330,000 civilians (DMDC, Aug 2023). Army Forces are organized into hierarchically nested groupings from teams of four up to corps with tens of thousands of members. The Army must operate within the Department of Defense and in coordination with the other services to provide the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation's security. Additionally, the Army must often engage with other federal agencies and increasingly at a multi-national, coalitional level. The composition, foci, and context of all elements in these systems are always changing.\n\nThe U.S. Army is an organization that must proactively change and adapt to meet evolving requirements and conditions while maintaining its longstanding identity, culture, and traditions. Service members  identities, characteristics, skills, and knowledge evolve as they progress through their careers. Individuals are reassigned to new teams or turnover from the organization entirely and new Soldiers enter it.\n\nSenior leadership develops and implements new strategy, and departmental regulations and policy shift. Further, the Army is not insulated from more general societal shifts and trends. These bottom-up/emergent, top-down, and external changes may flow throughout the organization at different tempos, exerting influence within and across levels. The Army s performance will depend on its ability to adapt and react, particularly within complex, changing operational environments.\n\n\n\n**Strategic Goal**. The primary objective within the Understanding Multilevel and Organizational Dynamics domain at the Organizations and Systems level, is to identify means to leverage methods and models of organizational functioning to effect deliberate intentional sustained systemic outcomes. The Research Objectives of this area are:\n\n-      Empirically Supported Organizational Theories \n\n    -     Balance the organizational research space with more empirical data-driven research \n\n    -     Identify factors that influence effectiveness at different or multiple levels of an organization (e.g., individual, dyad, team, team of teams, organization) and their interactions across levels\n\n-      Complex Systems and Time \n\n    -     Develop and investigate process-oriented theory to determine the underlying mechanisms of bottom-up and top-down influences on performance \n\n    -     Theories on organization interventions that account for implementation at different scales, multiple levels, and over time\n\n    -      Interactions between complex systems and organizations could also be considered\n\n-      Organizational Culture and Identity \n\n    -     Inception and dissemination of organizational cultural norms and identities \n\n    -     Complexity-oriented and/or networks-based theory and analytics to capture the multilevel and multifactored nature of organizations, particularly those with frequent between- and within-member changes \n\n    -    How organizations have and project out an identity and signal values and culture \n\n\n\nHigh Priority Research Questions\n\n1. How can recent advances in measurement, modeling, and analyses of multi-teams and multi-systems be leveraged to develop and further approaches to interventions at the organizational level?\n\n2. How do organizations build and cultivate trust from its members and at different levels and with external parties and systems? What is the relative contribution of trust in the organization and trust in team members to outcomes?\n\n3. What mechanisms allow deliberate influence on organizational cultural norms and identities. How do organizations signal out values and culture, and how do projections interact with culture at large?\n\n\n\n**3. Formal and Informal Learning and Development**\n\nThe U.S. Army is a learning organization that relies on career long growth and development of talent. Anticipated future operational environments create challenges for traditional education models and require advancement and creation of learning theories and methods that can be leveraged to meet the needs of tomorrow s Army. The operational landscape has evolved to include irregular warfare, stability operations, and multi-domain operations across land, sea, air, space, and cyber fronts. There is significant pressure on the Army, its educational institutions, Soldiers, and leaders to identify and optimally utilize all available learning vehicles to prepare for, adapt to, and maintain readiness and combat effectiveness in a broad range of possible environments.\n\nDeveloping Soldiers and leaders who are efficient lifelong and motivated adult learners is key to meeting the demands of the future. Soldiers and leaders who can learn new and complex skills quickly and effectively from both formal learning environments and informal learning environments will be valuable. Structures to support this charge must reflect the unique qualities of the adult learner. This requires a sustained focus on maximizing learning from and improving efficiency of formal learning environments, including individual or collective institutional training and technology-delivered training, as well as a focus on understanding to how to optimize informal learning environments like operational experience and self-development. Of interest is both how to guide the learner to most effectively and efficiently learn and how to structure the environment to support effective and efficient learning.\n\nLeaders are a key multiplying and unifying element of combat power. To meet the needs of the future, the Army requires leader development models, strategies, and measures to guide the Army to grow the leadership talent needed to face future challenges. Understanding how to prepare leaders to recognize and get the most out of leader development opportunities across domains and sources is crucial to develop leaders efficiently and effectively.\n\nLearning occurs at both the individual and the organizational level and both levels are relevant to the future needs of the Army. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that underly and facilitate both types of learning is crucial to developing well-prepared Soldiers and leaders for the demands of the future. Additionally, theories that explain the bidirectional connections between individual and collective learning will be key to understanding how to facilitate both among adult learners in complex and everchanging landscapes.\n\n\n\n**Strategic Goal**. The primary goal for the Basic Research program within the Formal and Informal Learning and Development domain is to understand, support, and optimize learning and development of Soldiers and leaders through both formal learning methods, operational experience, and self-development. The Research Objectives of this area are:\n\n-      Measures and Models of Learning and Development \n\n    -    Measurement approaches and theory that support non-obtrusive measurement of learning and development\n\n    -     Measures of learning and leader development that are sensitive to the effects of context in operational settings \n\n    -    Measures of learning and development at both individual and collective levels that capture change in knowledge and skill development, retention, near and far transfer over time, and the underlying learning processes (e.g., motivation, engagement, self-regulation, affect) in institutional, operational, and self-development realms\n\n-      Methods for Facilitating Adult Learning and Development \n\n    -     Methods for encouraging leaders to recognize and capitalize on leader development opportunities \n\n    -     Optimizing learning strategies that promote rapid development of complex skills in variable and high stakes environments \n\n    -     Innovative methods for how to prepare individuals, collectives, and environments to support learning and development \n\n    -     Tested and validated approaches for promoting effective and efficient adult learning and career-long learning\n\n  Models and Theories of Learning and Development \n\n    -     New or refined theory and models that explain the mechanism that underly both individual and collective learning to fuel individual, team, and organizational learning outcomes \n\n    -     Models that provide understanding of how both individual level factors, organizational factors, and environmental factors affect learning and development \n\n    -     Models and theories that advance understanding of self-regulated learning \n\n\n\n**High Priority Research Questions**.\n\n1. How do we structure environments and prepare individuals to be career-long learners? How do contextual factors facilitate or inhibit learning and development? What structural factors facilitate leader development in the instructional, operational, and self-development spheres?\n\n2. What learning methods and theory can be developed to maximize individual and collective learning processes and outcomes? What theory can be developed to understand the bidirectional relationships between individual and collective learning?\n\n3. How do we assess adult learning over time in operational and self-development realms with precision and accuracy? How do we capture contextual effects in measures of learning and development?\"",

        "description": " I**IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES**  \n\n\n\nInnovating and migrating proposal preparation and submission capabilities from FastLane to Research.gov is part of the ongoing NSF information technology modernization efforts, as described in [Important Notice No. 147](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=in147). In support of these efforts, research proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation must be prepared and submitted via Research.gov or via Grants.gov, and may not be prepared or submitted via FastLane.\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**\n\n\n\nA key aspect of Convergence Accelerator projects is the innovation curriculum that requires a significant time investment and frequent participation of all partners such as academia, industry, non-profit, government, and other sectors under the guidance of coaches (see section V and a link to a sample curriculum can be found [here](https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2021-12/Sample%20Curriculum%20Schedule_2021%20Cohort%20Phase%201.pdf)). The curriculum includes a team science and human-centered design approach that rapidly moves projects towards deliverables in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 that will have broad scale national impact.\n\n\n\n**REVISION NOTES**\n\n\n\nThe substantive changes in this FY 2022 solicitation include:\n\n\n\n-  A Letter of Intent is required for all Phase 1 Full Proposals.\n\n-  Meetings, including those associated with the innovation curriculum, Pitch Presentations, and Expo reflect changes in format resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and rules associated with in-person and/or virtual meetings.\n\n-  In Full Proposals, *Letters of Collaboration* are now submitted in a standard format. The participation of any unfunded collaborators in the project must be substantive and their roles and responsibilities should be clearly described in appropriate Sections of the Project Description.\n\n-  This solicitation and the corresponding BAA support both US-only proposals and proposals with international partnerships. For Track I only, this solicitation includes a collaboration with The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), an Australian Government agency responsible for scientific research. Participants who would like to qualify for CSIRO funding will submit their proposals as a single proposal, with the US Lead PIs submitting to NSF and the Australian Participants sharing information with CSIRO as described in the solicitation and the corresponding BAA.\n\n\n\nAny proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised *NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide* (PAPPG) ([NSF 22-1](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf22001&org=NSF)), which is effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after October 4, 2021.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**  \n\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Accelerator program addresses national-scale societal challenges through use-inspired [convergence research](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/convergent.jsp). Using a convergence approach and innovation processes like human-centered design, user discovery, and team science and integration of multidisciplinary research, the Convergence Accelerator program seeks to transition basic research and discovery into practice-to solve high-impact societal challenges aligned with specific research themes (tracks). \n\n\n\nNSF Convergence Accelerator tracks are chosen in concordance with the themes identified during the program's ideation process that have the potential for significant national impact. The NSF Convergence Accelerator implements a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation and are covered by this single solicitation and corresponding Broad Agency Announcement. The link to the corresponding Broad Agency Announcement can be found at [https://sam.gov/opp/cad229a574774c038559d0c9fc22d9b4/view](https://sam.gov/opp/cad229a574774c038559d0c9fc22d9b4/view). The purpose of this parallel funding opportunity is to provide increased opportunities for proposals that are led by non academic entities. Proposals that are led by Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), non-profits, independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies and similar organizations should respond to this solicitation. Proposals led by for profit or similar organizations should respond to the BAA. Phase 1 awardees receive resources to further develop their convergence research ideas and to identify important partnerships and resources to accelerate their projects. Phase 2 awardees receive significant resources leading to deliverable research prototypes and sustainability plans. \n\n\n\nThis solicitation for FY 2022 invites proposals for the following Track Topics:\n\n\n\n**Track H: Enhancing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities**\n\n\n\nThe NSF Convergence Accelerator's Track H: Enhancing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) will serve as a platform to bring together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders from a wide range of disciplines and sectors to work on use-inspired solutions to enhance quality of life and employment access and opportunities for PWDs. \n\n\n\n**Track I: Sustainable Materials for Global Challenges**\n\n\n\nThe objective of the NSF Convergence Accelerator's Track I: Sustainable Materials for Global Challenges will be to converge advances in fundamental materials science with materials design and manufacturing methods in an effort to couple their end-use and full life-cycle considerations for environmentally- and economically-sustainable materials and products.\n\n\n\n**Track J: Food & Nutrition Security**\n\n\n\nThe overarching goal of the NSF Convergence Accelerator's Track J: Food & Nutrition Security will be to accelerate convergence across food and nutrition sectors to address intertwined challenges in supporting population health, combating climate change, and addressing the nutritional needs of the most vulnerable by empowering youth, women, and disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nIt must be evident how the proposed work will be integrated to achieve success of the entire track. Each proposal should include a description of how the proposed project will contribute to an integrated environment that will deliver beneficial outputs for the track. It should also be clear how the projects will convergently align with the overarching goal of each track rather than as independent projects.\n\n\n\nProposers are required to submit a Letter of Intent in order to submit a Phase 1 Full Proposal. The information required in the Letter of Intent is described in Section V.\n\n\n\nLetters of Intent should identity a team with the appropriate mix of disciplinary and cross-sector expertise required to build a convergence research effort. Letters of Intent must identify one or more deliverables, how those research outputs could impact society at scale, and the team that will be formed to carry this out.\n\n\n\nPhase 1 proposals must describe the deliverables, a research plan, and the process of team formation that will help lead to a proof-of-concept during Phase 1.\n\n\n\nIf selected, Phase 1 awards may receive funding up to $750,000 for 12 months duration, of which nine months includes intense hands-on activities, centering around the Program's innovation curriculum, and three months of other activities, such as participation in the NSF Convergence Accelerator Pitch Presentations and Expo.\n\n\n\nDuring the nine-month intensive planning phase, teams will participate in a curriculum that will assist them in strengthening team convergence and accelerating the identified idea toward Phase 2. The curriculum provides modules on innovation processes, including human-centered design, user discovery, team science, and integration of multidisciplinary partnerships. Teams will also be provided with coaches who will support them in Phase 1 and who may continue with them into Phase 2 if the teams choose to continue with the same coach. Alternatively, the teams can request to work with a different coach. \n\n\n\nOnly awardees of Phase 1 awards under this solicitation may submit a Phase 2 proposal. Phase 2 proposals must outline a 24-month research and development plan that transitions research into practice through convergence activities, multi-sector partnerships, and collaboration with other partners and end-users.\n\n\n\nIf selected for Phase 2, teams will be expected to apply program fundamentals and innovation processes gained in Phase 1 to enhance partnerships, develop a solution prototype, and build a sustainability model to continue societal impact beyond NSF support.\n\n\n\nPhase 2 awards may be up to $5 million for 24 months. Phase 2 proposals must clearly describe deliverables that will be produced within 24 months. The Phase 2 teams must include partnerships critical for success and end-users (e.g., industry, Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), non-profits, government, and others), each with a specific role(s) in deliverable development and facilitating the transition of research outputs into practical uses. Successful Phase 2 proposals will be funded initially for 12 months, with a second year being provided on the basis of an assessment of performance (see below).\n\n\n\nEach Phase 2 team's progress will be assessed during the year through approximately four virtual and/or in-person meetings with NSF program staff. At the end of 12 months, overall progress will be evaluated based on a report and presentation that the team presents to a panel of internal and/or external reviewers. The review panel will include NSF reviewers and staff, and competing teams only. Phase 2 teams that show significant progress during the first year in accordance with the agreed timetable of milestones and deliverables will receive funding for a second year. Phase 2 teams must plan on completing the effort within 24 months. No-cost extensions are **not** permitted except under clearly documented exceptional circumstances. Grantees must first contact the cognizant Program Officer prior to submitting a request.\n\n\n\nThe NSF Convergence Accelerator program is committed to research that derives expertise from and provides broad benefits to everyone. The program places a very strong emphasis on broadening participation by encouraging proposals from, and partnerships with, minority-serving institutions (e.g., Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Alaska Native-Serving Institutions, Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institutions, and Native-American-serving nontribal Institutions, see also [U.S. Department of Education](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html)), and other organizations.\"",

Digital Asset Management \n\n2.  PFI Contracts \n\n3.  Standard Contracts \n\n4.  Standards for Smart Infrastructure \n\n\n\nThe Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) highlighted the government's commitment to high quality mobile connectivity where people live, work and travel. Advanced wireless networks (including 5G) are likely to entail greater deployment of digital infrastructure, including on publicly available assets (such as land, buildings and street furniture) to provide extra capacity in specific locations.\n\n\n\nThe Digital Connectivity Infrastructure Accelerator (DCIA) will help accelerate both investment in and the deployment of advanced wireless networks. The pilot competition supports this aim by helping to create efficiencies for local authorities and network providers using publicly available assets to support digital infrastructure.\n\n\n\nMarket engagement with Local Authorities has shown that both cost and timescales are both significant barriers in using publicly owned assets for digital infrastructure. To address this, DCMS is launching this competition with the aim of making the transactions between public sector location asset owners and telecommunications companies as frictionless as possible, lowering costs of site acquisition and accelerating the rollout of digital connectivity across participating regions.\n\n\n\nThe regions and their Local Authorities funded through this competition will work with industry partners to pilot a digital asset management platform to build evidence on how the digital mapping and brokerage of assets can benefit mobile network operators and their network delivery partners, users of mobile services (business and consumer) and the public sector, who are the primary providers of assets for hosting network equipment. A draft technical design specification outlines the minimum requirements for a digital asset management platform and has been co-developed with mobile telecommunication infrastructure providers (including all four major Mobile Network Operators), local authorities, government partners, and potential solution providers. Successful bidders are expected to source digital asset management platforms in line with functionality as described in the specification.\n\n\n\n**Who can apply?**  \n\n\n\nThis is an open competition, requiring submission from Regional or Local Authorities, with DCMS funding available for activity taking place in the UK.\n\n\n\nPlease note the following eligibility criteria for the grant funding:\n\n\n\nBids will be from a local or regional lead authority who will be the prime recipient of grant funding and who will be responsible for managing activities and for allocation of grant funding to its own partners.\n\n\n\nLead regional applicants will be accepted on the basis of existing political/geographic entities (regional authorities).\n\n\n\nWe will also consider applications from a group of multiple Local Authorities that have a contiguous geography; these applicants will be asked to demonstrate a signed collaboration agreement between themselves prior to any claim to DCMS for grant funding for the pilot.\n\n\n\nPilot projects are expected to run from January-December 2022.\"",

        "description": "\"**What we're looking for**\n**Aim**\n\n\n\nThis funding opportunity is part of [Future Marine Research Infrastructure (FMRI)](https://fmri.ac.uk/) programme.\n\n\n\nThrough this funding opportunity NERC aims to de-risk the rapid integration and deployment of sensors into marine autonomous platforms for future marine research. The sensors should focus on biogeochemical essential ocean variables, such as oxygen and nitrogen concentration, pH, and Chlorophyll a concentration (for further details, see Supporting Links in the 'Additional Information' section).\n\n\n\nThis funding opportunity will support the later stages of marine sensor development and bridge the gap between  prototype  and  successful product with potential for commercial deployment . The result will be novel marine sensor capabilities that have been proven in their operating environment and are ready to be included in future national research infrastructure. This will enhance UK s marine research capability by demonstrating the advanced abilities of autonomous research infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe objectives of the funding opportunity are to:\n\n\n\n-   support up to four, two-year projects to develop biogeochemical sensors for integration into autonomous platforms available within the UK s National Marine Equipment Pool\n\n-   develop autonomous research infrastructure that enables novel approaches to addressing current and future scientific priorities\n\n-   accelerate the adoption of innovative measurement systems and enhance best practice methodologies for the integration and use of novel sensors across a range of autonomous platforms\n\n\n\n**Scope**\n\n\n\nFor this funding opportunity we are offering funding for the creation of a capital asset.\n\n\n\nProjects must focus on the delivery of world leading transformational innovation into the enhancement or adaptation for marine use of existing, high-TRL (expected TRL 7 to 9 classification provided in the  Additional information  section) biogeochemical sensors, integration with autonomous underwater platforms from the National Marine Equipment Pool (NMEP), and a real-world validation trial.\n\n\n\nAwarded projects will be required to:\n\n\n\n-   collaborate with National Oceanography Centre (NOC) on the integration to NMEP autonomous underwater platforms\n\n-   collaborate with each other during the delivery of a coordinated field-trial\n\n\n\nApplications should:\n\n\n\n-   create new or build upon existing sensors to increase the capability of biogeochemical sensors available to scientists. It is expected that developed sensors will in future be part of the NMEP and should be of a standard to be reliably operated by National Marine Facilities technicians\n\n-   enhance the TRL of the proposed sensors to levels 7 to 9 (TRL 7 to 9, TRL classification provided in the  Additional information ). Applications with TRL 7 need to demonstrate the feasibility and plan to exceed TRL 7 after the field-trials. All applications will be assessed by an independent panel and applications for TRL 7 will be rejected if the panel determines that there is no potential for achieving levels 8 to 9. In the final trial, sensors should provide co-sampling alongside ship sensors, or other sensors, for data validation\n\n-   provide evidence that autonomous platforms can support high quality marine observations\n\n-   build best-practice and workforce skills in marine sensor development, integration and scientific utilisation\n\n-   where possible, include industry partnership that offers the potential for commercial procurement of the demonstrated technology\n\n\n\nApplications are encouraged to:\n\n\n\n-   represent a consortium of academic organisations jointly leading on this opportunity. The collaboration must show a clear and joint strategy for delivering the vision and fostering the growth and maturation of collaboration during the funding period. Successful applications should demonstrate how the project benefits from the collaboration with justification of the structure, providing a clear case for the consortium size. Please see Consortium section for detailed information\n\n-   include non-academic organisations as appropriate (such as industry and public sector organisations) as project partners. Applicants need to demonstrate that there is significant value added from the inclusion of a project partner, such as potential for commercialisation of developed sensors. See Project partners section for detailed information and criteria\n\n\n\n**Technical considerations**\n\n\n\nThe National Marine Equipment Pool (NMEP), based at National Oceanography Centre (NOC), will provide access to autonomous platforms. Successful applicants will collaborate with NOC on technical aspects enabling the integration of sensors into operational platforms. In the first instance, principal investigators should approach the FMRI programme director, Kristian Thaller \\[email: [fmri@noc.ac.uk](mailto:fmri@noc.ac.uk)\\], for queries about the sensor integration and fieldwork, or FMRI related.\n\n\n\nOnce full applications have been assessed, the project leads (previously principal investigators) of the applications recommended for funding will be invited to work together with National Marine Facilities to develop a final version of the Accelerating Adoption of Sensor Innovation trials plan.\n\n\n\nProposed sensors must:\n\n\n\n-   fill a capability gap by providing scientists access to biogeochemical sensors compatible with autonomous underwater platforms in the NMEP\n\n-   be able to be integrated with one or more of the following platforms available through the NMEP: Autosub Long Range, Konsberg Seaglider and Teledyne Slocum Glider. These autonomous platforms within the NMEP are made available to NERC community. Other platforms will be considered if they can demonstrate feasible adoption of the sensor into the NMEP on the completion of the project\n\n-   output an RS232 data stream. Exceptions may be considered if the integration effort is assessed as viable within the time and budget constraints\n\n-   provide standardized descriptors in machine readable format\n\n-   be robust and reliable, able to be operated by National Marine Facilities technicians\n\n\n\n****Field trial****\n\n\n\nNOC will facilitate a field trial in which all funded capabilities will be demonstrated, and the technologies validated.\n\n\n\nFunding for the use of NERC s marine facilities and ships will be NERC s responsibility and the applicants will not be required to include the funding in their costs, but will be required to submit the Autonomous Deployment Forms (ADFs) to the Marine Facilities Planning website detailing the Marine Autonomous and Robotics systems (MARS) platforms requirements for their application.\n\n\n\nThe details outlining applications for the use of NERC s ships and MARS platforms in the NMEP are provided in the section,  Services and facilities, NERC marine facilities .\n\n\n\nProjects must collaborate with the NOC and each other to develop a trial that:\n\n\n\n-   validates the performance of the developed sensor\n\n-   demonstrates the success of the platform integration and provides insight into any limitations of the developed system\n\n-   enables integration of the sensor into the National Marine Equipment Pool\n\n\n\n****Reporting****\n\n\n\nGrant holders will be required to report on the progress of the sensor development to NERC annually through ResearchFish in line with standard UK Research and Innovation ([UKRI) grant terms and conditions](https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/meeting-ukri-terms-and-conditions-for-funding/).\n\n\n\nThis project is part of the Future Marine Research Infrastructure (FMRI) programme and short progress updates will be required to report to the FMRI Programme Office every six months from the start of the grant.\n\n\n\nSuccessful applicants will be expected to respond to other reporting requirements when requested.\n\n\n\n****Duration****\n\n\n\nThe duration of this award is a maximum of 18 months.\n\n\n\nAll projects must start by 15 August 2024.\n\n\n\n****Funding available****\n\n\n\nThe full economic cost (FEC) of your funded project can be up to £800,000 (including VAT).\n\n\n\nIt is expected that activities are primarily focused on the development and integration of sensors for use in underwater autonomous platforms. As a result of this focus on sensors and integration, all costs are expected to be capitalisable.\n\n\n\nWhen developing a capital asset, we deem all development costs that are directly attributable to the creation, production, and preparation of the asset, and effort to bring it into working condition as capitalisable. This includes:\n\n\n\n-   equipment costs and development costs directly associated with asset creation, and those of the component pieces that may go into the asset. This may include costs for transport, delivery, installation, testing, benchmarking and verification against existing assets or data sets, in order for it to become operational\n\n-   labour costs (for staff working on the technical aspects) can be capitalised to get the asset into a usable state. It does not matter who provides the labour\n\n-   full staff costs where staff are significantly working on delivering an asset, including for staff recruited to a new role directly associated with the technical development of the asset. This includes direct costs, that is cash staff costs (salary, NI, pension), and any indirect costs and overheads costs for staff directly associated with technical development of the asset (Indirect and Estates costs under FEC terminology)\n\n-   where staff work on multiple projects, only the proportion of the full staff costs associated with the hours working technically on the asset development to get it operational (that is to a useable state) will be funded\n\n-   fees to register a legal right, and amortisation of patents or licences used to generate the asset\n\n-   estates or infrastructure upgrades needed to make the equipment a usable asset\n\n\n\nWe will fund 100% of the FEC for capital equipment, and associated costs (see  What we will fund ).\n\n\n\nA single grant will be awarded to the lead research organisation.\n\n\n\nApplications that request contributions to an already planned asset, or that will be co-funded by an institute to deliver the requested asset, should not include institute contributions in the total grant value. In such instances, you must clearly state in your answer to the  Resources and costs  section:\n\n\n\n-   how much funding has been acquired from elsewhere?\n\n-   how much funding is being requested from NERC?\n\n\n\nThese applications will require sign off from your institute s finance director (or equivalent) and if your application is successful then we will request a letter of support.\n\n\n\nWe reserve the right to work with successful applicants to determine the spend profile.\n\n\n\n**What we will fund**\n\n\n\nFor this funding opportunity we are offering funding for the creation of a capital asset. Your application must:\n\n\n\n-   create new or build upon existing sensors\n\n-   enhance the TRL  of the proposed sensors to level 7 to 9 (TRL classification provided in the  Additional information  section)\n\n\n\nCapital costs can include labour and development costs associated with the creation of the asset such as:\n\n\n\n-   transport\n\n-   delivery\n\n-   installation\n\n-   biogeochemical sensor development\n\n-   biogeochemical sensor integration to underwater autonomous platforms\n\n\n\nThese costs must be entered under the equipment fund heading only.\n\n\n\nSupport from industry partners in the form of expertise (in-kind support) or leveraged funding (financial support) is welcomed as evidence of increased asset impact and reach.\n\n\n\n**What we will not fund**\n\n\n\n-   PhD studentship costs\n\n-   staff costs will not be funded on this award after the creation of the asset, such as resourcing related to operation or maintenance\n\n\n\n-   incidental costs such as project office support\n\n\n\n-   insurance and servicing including warranties\n\n-   user training after the asset s creation\n\n-   routine replacement and, or, repair of assets, such as:\n\n    -   building repairs\n\n    -   maintenance\n\n    -   scheduled replacement of standard equipment\n\n    -   costs related to rent or leasing\n\n    -   single-user or single-project equipment\n\n-   new technologies which are unlikely to generate a productive asset\n\n-   applications submitted to other funding opportunities during the same time frame (including all UKRI grant schemes)\n\n\n\n**Services and facilities****NERC marine facilities**\n\n\n\nThis funding opportunity will require access to Marine Autonomous and Robotics Systems (MARS) platforms in the National Marine Equipment Pool, operated by National Marine Facilities (NMF) at the National Oceanography Centre. A budget of £1m is available for NMF support costs (for example, ship time, technician, marine equipment and autonomous systems costs). These costs do not need to be included within each application budget and will be funded separately by NERC, to allow coordinated collaboration of sensor integration and field demonstration.\n\n\n\nProject leads should inform [NERC Marine Planning](mailto:marineplanning@nerc.ukri.org) as soon as possible, and by 2 April 2024 at the latest, to advise that an application is being prepared.\n\n\n\nNERC will coordinate discussions related to seagoing science delivery ahead of applications being submitted, and will submit an SME to the Marine Facilities Planning website for the shiptime requirements of the sensor demonstration research cruise.\n\n\n\nFollowing initial discussion, project leads must submit Autonomous Deployment Forms (ADFs) to the Marine Facilities Planning website detailing the MARS platform requirements for their application by 11 April 2024. These requests must have been assessed and approved by NMF and NERC Marine Planning ahead of application submission to NERC.\n\n\n\nOnce the applications have been assessed, the project leads of the applications recommended for funding will be invited to work together with NMF to develop a final version of the sensor demonstration delivery plan. This plan will efficiently accommodate all aims wherever possible within the £1M funding available for NMF support costs.\n\n\n\nThe final sensors demonstration plan is likely to comprise of a single research cruise in spring-summer 2026 in the NE Atlantic, sailing Southampton to Southampton, and applications should ensure the delivery of science objectives is achievable based on this timeline. There might be a possibility to augment delivery by opportunistic involvement in other scheduled cruises, that will collectively meet the trials requirements of all funded applications. NERC may ask project leads to adjust science plans so that an affordable cruise plan can be agreed, and grants can be awarded.\n\n\n\n**Other NERC Services and facilities**\n\n\n\nWe are not expecting the use of a facility as part of your application, however you can apply to use a facility or resource in your funding application.\n\n\n\nApplications should include formal requests for NERC services and facilities (for example, high-performance computing (HPC) or isotope analyses) where relevant. No additional funding is available to cover these costs. Therefore, all costs associated with the use of NERC services and facilities (excluding those related to NMF that are outlined) must be included within:\n\n\n\n-   the funding limit of applications\n\n-   the directly incurred other costs of applications\n\n\n\nPrior to submitting an application, applicants wishing to use a NERC service or facility must contact the facility to seek agreement that they could provide the service required. Applicants wishing to use most NERC facilities will need to submit a mandatory  technical assessment  with their application. This technical assessment is required for aircraft but not for NERC marine facilities and HPC. For NERC, this means a quote for the work which the facility will provide. See a [full list of the facilities requiring this quote](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/facilities-and-resources/find-a-nerc-facility-or-resource/). See further information on [NERC services and facilities](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/facilities-and-resources/find-a-nerc-facility-or-resource/).\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the [NERC research grants and fellowships handbook](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/guidance-for-applicants/handbooks-guidance-and-forms/).\n\n\n\nRead the full list of [NERC facilities that require a technical assessment](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/facilities-and-resources/find-a-nerc-facility-or-resource/).\n\n\n\n**Supporting skills and talent**\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to follow the principles of the [Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers](https://researcherdevelopmentconcordat.ac.uk/) and the [Technician Commitment](https://www.techniciancommitment.org.uk/).\n\n\n\nAs one of the funders to sign the , we recognise the value of technical expertise to the UK workforce. To reflect this, we welcome applications from all eligible faculty staff as either project lead or project co-leads.\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral research assistants involved in the development of the application can be included as a researcher co-lead.\n\n\n\n****Responsible research****\n\n\n\nThrough our funding processes, we seek to make a positive contribution to society and the environment. This is not just through research outputs and outcomes but through the way in which research is conducted and facilities managed.\n\n\n\nAll NERC grant holders are to adopt responsible research practices as set out in the [NERC responsible business statement](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/nerc/our-policies-and-standards/nerc-as-a-responsible-business/).\n\n\n\nResponsible research is defined as reducing harm or enhancing benefit on the environment and society through effective management of research activities and facilities. Specifically, this covers:\n\n\n\n-   the natural environment\n\n-   equality, diversity and inclusion\n\n\n\nYou should consider the responsible research context of your project, not the host institution as a whole. You should take action to enhance your responsible research approach where practical and reasonable.\n\n\n\n**Research disruption due to COVID-19**\n\n\n\nWe recognise that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major interruptions and disruptions across our communities. We are committed to ensuring that individual applicants and their wider team, including partners and networks, are not penalised for any disruption to their career, such as:\n\n\n\n-   breaks and delays\n\n-   disruptive working patterns and conditions\n\n-   the loss of ongoing work\n\n-   role changes that may have been caused by the pandemic\n\n\n\nReviewers and panel members will be advised to consider the unequal impacts that COVID-19 related disruption might have had on the capability to deliver and career development of those individuals included in the application. They will be asked to consider the capability of the applicant, and their wider team, to deliver the research they are proposing.\n\n\n\nWhere disruptions have occurred, you can highlight this within your application if you wish, but there is no requirement to detail the specific circumstances that caused the disruption.\"",

        "description": " Information Processing1\\. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES\n\n\n\na. This is a BAA of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This acquisition is unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of this solicitation. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology), and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.\n\n\n\nb. AFRL/RW awards to educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Air Delivered Effects.

Use of available base support will not be assumed during technical evaluation unless proposed.\n\n\n\nb. In accordance with AFRL/CC Policy on Employment of Non-US Citizen Contractors dated 4 October 2016, Contractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology networks in connection with the work on this BAA must be U.S. Citizens. Possession of a permanent resident card (\"Green Card\") does not equate to U.S. Citizenship. This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of efense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments. Any waivers to this requirement will be granted in writing by the CO prior to providing access. The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC).\n\n\n\nc. Multiple awards subject to Fair Opportunity are not anticipated.\n\n\n\nd. Human subjects may be used in the research studies under this effort. DFARS 252.235-7004, Protection of Human Subjects (Jul 2009), will be included in all contracts awarded under this BAA.\n\n\n\ne. Data Rights Desired:\n\n\n\n1) Technical Data: Unlimited Rights\n\n\n\n2) Non-Commercial Software (NCS): Unlimited Rights\n\n\n\n3) NCS Documentation: Unlimited Rights\n\n\n\n4) Commercial Computer Software Rights: Customary License\n\n\n\nf. The Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and NCS developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology. In exchange for paying for development of the data, the Government expects technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation developed entirely at Government expense to be delivered with Unlimited Rights.\n\n\n\ng. Technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation developed with mixed funding are expected to be delivered with at least Government Purpose Rights. Offers that propose delivery of technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation subject to Government Purpose Rights should fully explain how the data were developed at private expense. Specifically, offers must explain what technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation developed with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a Government contract will be incorporated, how the incorporation will benefit the program, and whether those portions or processes are segregable.\n\n\n\nh. Offers that propose delivery of technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation subject to Limited Rights, Restricted Rights, or Specifically Negotiated License Rights will be considered. Proposals should fully explain what technical data, NCS, or NCS documentation developed with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a Government contract will be incorporated and how the incorporation will benefit the program and whether those portions or processes are segregable.\n\n\n\ni. Offerors SHALL provide data rights/software assertions, as part of their proposal submittal, as required by DFARS 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions (Jan 2011). Assertions must be completed with specificity. Each assertion must identify both the data/software and each such item, component, or process listed. Nonconforming assertions will be rejected and will require resubmittal.\n\n\n\nj. Terms used in this section are defined in the clauses at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items (Feb 2014) and 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation (Feb 2014).\n\n\n\n5\\. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE (COMMERCIAL AND NONCOMMERICAL):\n\n\n\na. DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software. Any third party software (commercial or noncommercial) to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the CO.\n\n\n\nb. Any third party software to be delivered to the Government that is not reasonably identifiable at proposal submission, must still be approved by the CO prior to incorporation into a system deliverable. This obligation to obtain pre-approval by the CO, as described above, continues throughout contract administration.\n\n\n\nc. The Government will neither accept nor execute a DD Form 250 for the software deliverables until the Contractor obtains from all third party software suppliers and/or vendors (Licensor) licenses that comply with the following terms and conditions for the Government (Licensee):\n\n\n\n1) The license shall not subject the Government to liability that is indefinite, such as an indemnification clause, as it would constitute an obligation in advance or in excess of an appropriation and violate the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n\n\n\n2) The license shall not create a contingent liability for the Government. This includes, but is not limited to: unilateral price increases, automatic assessment of charges, and automatic renewal of the license.\n\n\n\n3) The license shall be governed by Federal Statutes, Case Law, and Federal Regulations, and shall not be subject to the laws or jurisdiction of any municipality, state, or foreign country.\n\n\n\n4) The license shall not include non-substitution language that would preclude or limit the Government from using another vendor/reseller and/or product to fulfill Government requirements.\n\n\n\n5) The license shall not comment an entitlement to attorney fees.\n\n\n\n6) The Licensor shall not have the authority to unilaterally terminate the license. All remedies available shall be consistent with the Disputes Clause in the contract.\n\n\n\n7) The Licensor shall not have the right to enter the premise or monitor the networks of  Licensee for the purpose of auditing the use of the license.\n\n\n\n8) The Licensor shall not use any injunctive relief clauses as the Licensor cannot prevent the Licensee from performing mission operations.\n\n\n\n9) The Licensor shall not have the authority to control any litigation between a third party and Licensee.\n\n\n\n10) The Licensor shall not use the fact that the Licensee is using the Licensor's products in any notification to the public (e.g., no publicity rights permitted).\n\n\n\nd. The Contractor may be required to obtain licenses that comply with the following terms and conditions, based on the Government's needs:\n\n\n\n1) The license shall not disclaim all warranties through use of an  as is provision.\n\n\n\n2) The license shall neither restrict the Government from using the product at various sites nor limit use of the product by various Government agencies or third parties performing work on behalf of the Department of the Air Force under this Air Delivered Effects BAA.

Specifically, the following sections are hereby deleted from the [Software License] [and/or amended as indicated below]:\n\n\n\nIf the Licensor will not agree to the terms and conditions cited herein and/or as contained in DFARS 227.72, the Contractor shall retain the current license on behalf of and for the benefit of the US Government if permissible under its license and such use will not subject the Government to the terms of the license. \n\n\n\n7) The Contractor shall provide documentation to clearly correlate or map software license(s) to:\n\n\n\ni. Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs);\n\n\n\nii. Contract Deliverables per the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL);\n\n\n\niii. Paragraphs in the Statement of Work (SOW) and Statement of Objectives (SOO)\n\n\n\niv. Portions of any functional block diagrams and/or system architecture diagrams, so that it can be readily determined where certain commercial software corresponding to certain software license agreement(s) are physically located on the system to be delivered under the contract.\n\n\n\n2\\.  RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOPRINCIPIC SENSORS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, AND CONTROL (RWTCA)\n\n\n\nFlying insects and smart munitions often need to perform similar tasks that require sensing, processing, and control.  However, biological systems tend to be much more robust and have significantly lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) than their engineered counterparts.  In fact, flying insects are existence proofs of goal-oriented, autonomous agents that can detect, identify, and intercept targets while avoiding threats in uncertain and highly dynamic environments.   Researchers at the Munitions Directorate are determined to understand the principles underlying the abilities of relevant biological organisms (not just flying insects) and apply those principles to future engineered systems to improve performance, lower SWaP, and achieve trusted autonomy in man-made systems.  We refer to such systems as bioprincipic and we believe this approach may lead to revolutionary concepts and capabilities for future Air Force systems.  The Government wants to use what is understood about the natural sensors to build small and affordable autonomous munitions sensors. Sensors of interest include multi-spectral and polarimetric electro-optical / infrared (EO/IR) imaging sensors, mechanosensors of various types and applications (including acoustic sensors), magnetosensors, and chemosensors.  Often biological systems use multiple sensing modalities and efficiently combine the sensor outputs to achieve robust behavior in dynamic environments.  Furthermore, an integrated sensor design includes not only the hardware component, but the \"software\" or \"algorithm\" that does the information processing. The Department of Defense is interested in sparse/compressive sensing, neuromorphic/spiking architectures, and analog and hybrid processing techniques when they show speed and accuracy advantages over pure digital processing. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate.\"",

        "title": "\"Kleinhans Fellowship for Community Forestry Research\"",
        "description": "\"As governments around the world recognize the importance of local stakeholders in forest management and conservationHowever, while the number of community forest enterprises (CFEs) is increasing, many CFEs are struggling to manage their forest resources sustainably while also making a profit and ensuring the equitable use of their financial returns. This struggle is exacerbated by intense pressure to convert their forests.\n\n\n\nCFEs face a host of challenges including weak organizational capacity, lack of access to finance, limited business-administration skills, difficulty competing with illegal forest products and the absence of markets for certain lesser-known species.\n\n\n\nThe Rainforest Alliance has a long history of working with forest communities that have established their own locally managed enterprises, providing them with training and technical assistance on sustainable forestry practices, value-added processing, business administration, market access and more. Recognizing that sound scientific inquiry can help to guide technical assistance for local development, our Kleinhans Fellowship supports research that seeks solutions to the challenges faced by the community forestry model.\n\n\n\n**Position Summary:**\n\nThe fellowship provides funds for research that is oriented toward solving real-world problems as defined by CFEs. Moreover, the planning, implementation and dissemination of research results will be carried out in participatory manner to ensure that it has practical value for communities and helps to inform their action plans. See a list of previous Kleinhans Fellows  \n\n\n\n**RESEARCH TOPICS**\n\nThe Kleinhans Fellowship provides a two-year stipend of US$20,000 per year to support research that addresses one of the following topics:\n\n\n\n1.    Markets for lesser-known species and non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Most community forestry products are unlikely to reach international markets, but domestic markets in many tropical forest countries are being flooded with illegal wood products, making it hard for legitimate operations-especially CFEs to compete. The absence of markets for lesser-known species and NTFPs further impedes optimal forest management and is a critical hurdle that must be overcome if CFEs are to become economically viable. The fellowship supports research that systematically documents and analyzes the creation and maintenance of domestic markets for diversified forest products, helps determine what drives success and recommends future actions.\n\n2.    Biodiversity management practices. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest management standard requires practices that conserve biodiversity, such as the protection of High Conservation Value Forests and the creation of riparian buffers. The Kleinhans Fellowship supports research that explores the feasibility of implementing such practices at the community level and their effects on the economic viability of CFEs.\n\n3.    Social organization and governance. Technical assistance programs are often limited in their ability to invest in organizational capacity building. The fellowship supports research that investigates modes of social organization and highlights both problems and innovative, replicable solutions for CFE governance. Topics of interest include equitable participation and transparency in decision-making and benefit-sharing; human resource management and business training; and governance aspects such as CFE bylaws, compliance and legal status.\n\n4.    Multi-community enterprises. Without access to financing, CFEs often get mired in debt, are beholden to high-risk, high-cost lenders and cannot invest in developing their businesses. CFEs are often encouraged to work together to aggregate supply, invest collectively and access financing, but it can be difficult to put these strategies into practice. The fellowship supports research that examines multi-community enterprises, documents and analyzes their successes and failures, and makes recommendations for future investment in the development of such ventures.\"",

        "title": "\"F.12 Artemis III Deployed Instruments Program\"",
        "description": "\"Number: NNH23ZDA001N-A3DI\n**1. Introduction and Funding Opportunity Description** \n\nThrough this Artemis III Deployed Instruments program element, NASA's Science Mission Directorate solicits proposals for instruments to be deployed on the surface of the Moon during Artemis III, the first crewed landing of the Artemis program. Payloads selected through this program element will be part of the Artemis III payload manifest; proposers interested in flying payloads on the second crewed landing should refer to F.21 Artemis IV Deployed Instruments Program. Artemis III will be a landed mission in the south polar region of the Moon, within 6  of latitude from the south pole, providing potential access to surface-accessible volatile deposits. Several of the proposed landing regions are located among some of the oldest parts of the Moon, and together with the permanently shadowed regions, provide the opportunity to learn about the history of the Moon through previously unstudied lunar materials.\n\n\n\nDeployed instruments consist of autonomous instrument packages installed on the lunar surface by astronauts during extravehicular activities (EVAs). These science packages will enable a variety of geophysical and environmental investigations. In addition to their intrinsic science value, some measurements from deployed instruments may also reduce risks to astronauts (e.g., goals 7a-m in Section 5.7 of the Artemis III Science Definition Team Report).\n\n\n\nProposed deployed instruments must address one or more of the scientific objectives outlined in the Artemis III Science Definition Team (SDT) Report. These objectives are:\n\n-      Understanding planetary processes\n\n-      Understanding the character and origin of lunar polar volatiles\n\n-      Interpreting the impact history of the Earth-Moon system\n\n-      Revealing the record of the ancient sun and our astronomical environment\n\n-      Observing the universe and the local space environment from a unique location\n\n-      Conducting experimental science in the lunar environment\n\n-      Investigating and mitigating exploration risks \n\n\n\nIn addition to these objectives, the SDT report also described a candidate science program that includes measurements to be made by deployed instruments. Specific investigations identified include geophysical monitoring and characterization, environmental monitoring and characterization, and understanding the human impact on the Moon. Preference will be given to instruments that address one or more of these measurements. Instruments addressing other high priority SDT objectives are also welcome and may be selected based on availability of mass, funding, and programmatic considerations.\n\n\n\nGiven that a laser retroreflector is already pre-manifested for the first crewed Artemis landing, laser retroreflectors are not being solicited for this Artemis III Deployed Instruments (A3DI) call.\n\nOther investigations that are in scope for this call include, but are not limited to, studies of plant biology, concrete microstructure using lunar regolith, flammability of solid materials, soft media flow, quantum physics, and theory of relativity and the equivalence principle.\n\n\n\nDeployed instruments must have clear scientific goals; instruments that are purely technology demonstrations or solely for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) are outside of the scope of this call. Sample return for deployed instruments is limited to <500 g in total across all investigations and must be either non-geological samples or consist of derived regolith, and crew time for retrieving samples must be estimated and justified.\n\nPurely geological samples that must be returned to Earth are outside the scope of this call.  Proposals requiring lower (or zero) return mass and minimal crew time are preferred.\n\n\n\n**2. Scope and Background Information** \n\nThis program element solicits both standalone instruments and instrument suites to conduct the science investigations identified in Section 1 that can be uniquely accomplished by human deployment of payloads at the landing site for Artemis III (see Section 2.1). NASA encourages instruments that can address more than one measurement need and/or science investigation, including those that have the ancillary benefit of increasing crew safety and/or reducing risk for future missions (e.g., goals 7a-m in the Artemis III SDT).\n\n\n\nProposals must include:\n\n-      Expected science results from the investigation;\n\n-      Instrument concept of operations, including why crew are needed for deployment, how the instrument is to be deployed, any special requirements for deployment (i.e., positioning, surface slope, etc.), an estimate of the crew time needed for deployment, and an overview of the real-time Earth-based science support needed to deploy the instrument during EVA;\n\n-      Resource requirements for the proposed investigation including cost, mass, volume, power, telemetry, data transfer need, astronaut interaction, etc.;\n\n-      Demonstration of adherence to basic safety requirements and human factors design; see Proposal Information Package (PIP).\n\n\n\n*2.1 Landing Site* \n\nScientific investigations with instruments solicited in this call must either be responsive to a polar landing region or be site-agnostic. For Artemis III, NASA has identified 13 candidate landing regions near the lunar South Pole. Each of these regions is located within six degrees of latitude of the lunar South Pole and, collectively, contain diverse geologic features. Specific landing sites are tightly coupled to the timing of the launch window, so having multiple regions ensures flexibility to accommodate different launch windows. Therefore, the specific landing site may not be known until close to launch.\n\n\n\n*2.2 Information for Biological and Physical Sciences Payloads* \n\nThe NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) is interested in investigating the properties of physical systems, including their functions and behavior, in the radiation environment and one-sixth gravity of the Moon. In addition to the objectives in the Artemis III SDT Report, proposers in the biological and physical sciences must also demonstrate relevance to priorities in the National Academy of Sciences 2010-2020\n\nDecadal Report \"Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era.\" Such proposals must provide a clear rationale and justification for why the studies require being conducted on the surface of the Moon.\n\nProposals that address BPS topics must comply with all the requirements, specifications, and constraints defined in this solicitation.\n\n\n\nBPS space biology topic awardee(s) may be contacted by a representative of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) with instructions for archiving returned specimens that may be used by other investigators. The ALSDA is the official repository for non-human biological specimens generated by NASA's Space Biology Program. Its associated NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC) is a biorepository of non-human samples from NASA-funded spaceflight investigations and correlative ground studies. The primary purpose of the NBISC is to identify, document, preserve, and make the collection available to the public community.\n\n\n\nAll proposers in the biological and physical sciences must review and understand all of the solicitation information, including the required proposal content, because this opportunity is different from the standard Biological and Physical Sciences Division ROSES elements (see Sections 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0). This program element requires the inclusion of additional details concerning identification of the specific hardware/instrument and its development; operations; planning and management; and budgetary information in addition to the science and science budget of the proposal.\n\nAdditionally, the review process includes separate science and technical peer reviews.\n\nIf one or more of the proposal content elements are missing, the proposal may be considered non-compliant and declined without review or following review.\n\n\n\nA BPS-focused virtual workshop will be held prior to the primary pre-proposal conference to go over the differences between this A3DI opportunity and BPS ROSES program elements to familiarize the BPS science community who are new to this proposal format of ROSES. This virtual workshop will be open to all perspective proposers but will primarily focus on information relevant to BPS proposers. See Section 3.5 for information on the pre-proposal conference and virtual workshop.\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\n****Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.***\n\n\n\n**NOAA Office/Lab and Location:** A research opportunity is currently available with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the Coral Health & Disease Program that resides in the NCCOS Stressor Detection and Impacts Division (SDI), Key Species and Bioinformatics (KSB) Branch at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) within the National Ocean Service (NOS) research arm in 1999 as the focal point for NOAA's coastal ocean science efforts. The NCCOS uses cutting-edge research and high-tech instrumentation to provide citizens, coastal managers, public health officials, and other decision makers with reliable information needed to determine how best to protect environmental resources and public health, preserve valued habitats, and improve the way communities interact with coastal ecosystems. The NCCOS is headquartered in Silver Spring, MD but also has research labs across the nation. The NCCOS also has many assets including research programs, vessels, laboratories, and a vast pool of distinguished scientists and experts.\n\n\n\nThe Coral Health and Disease Program brings a health perspective, patterned after evidence-based medicine and public health, to scientific investigations that address coastal issues affecting the health of our marine resources. The goal is to bring relevant, science-based information to decision-makers and the public to assist them in choosing effective actions to reduce threats to our coral reef resources and help restore damaged reefs. This is accomplished through field and laboratory investigations that adapt or develop advanced technologies to investigate the underlying causes of impairments, establish biological benchmarks suitable for management, and assist in devising solutions to reduce threats to the nation's coral reef ecosystems.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** Are you a driven master's/PhD scientist passionate about advancing knowledge in bottlenecks to recovering and restoring coral reef ecosystems and defining molecular underpinnings of resilience? This fellowship will use biomedical and ecotoxicological approaches to conduct strategic research to elucidate the physical, chemical and/or biological threats to NOAA's Mission Iconic Reefs Program (MIR) with the goal of formulating threat reduction strategies. MIR is an unparalleled effort in scope to restore seven iconic reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Through this cutting-edge research, you will play a role in determining the health status of these reef sites and their suitability for supporting coral restoration efforts.\n\n\n\nAs a master's/PhD Fellow, you will participate in transdisciplinary research projects aimed at unraveling the complex interactions between environmental stressors, organismal fitness and toxicological impacts on coral reef ecosystems. Through a combination of laboratory exposure-response experiments, bioassay analyses, and advanced data interpretation, you will contribute valuable insights into the susceptibility, resilience and vulnerability of key reef habitats.\n\n\n\nProject Activities:\n\n\n\n-  Characterization of Restoration Sites: Conduct sequential toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) studies of sediment porewater guided by multi-species bioassays to determine toxicological effects and identify putative causes of observed effects. This activity will involve learning to culture photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic non-model organisms, identify growth and developmental life stages and associated abnormalities, and the opportunity to contribute to the development of new bioassays to refine effects endpoints and better understand species sensitivity distributions.\n\n-  Assay Development: Employ state-of-the-art analytical/bioanalytical techniques to characterize endpoints of effect and/or exposure within reef environments targeting various anthropogenic stressors (e.g., nutrients, contaminants) that are affecting the health of key reef taxa.\n\n-  Data Integration and Modeling: Integrate field observations, toxicological, and bioassay data to develop predictive models of reef health and resilience. Utilize advanced statistical methods and spatial analysis techniques to areas of habitat suitability within the MIR sites in the Florida Keys.\n\n-  Collaborative Research and Knowledge Exchange: Engage with transdisciplinary research teams, including invertebrate biologists, biochemists, molecular/cellular biologists, environmental chemists, toxicologists, and resource managers, to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange. Contribute to scientific publications, conference presentations, and stakeholder workshops aimed at disseminating research findings and informing conservation strategies.\n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n\n\n\n-  Participate in innovative research at the intersection of biomedicine, biochemistry, toxicology and coral reef ecosystem management.\n\n-  Gain hands-on experience in advanced laboratory techniques with non-model organisms including coral and other reef organisms in experimental exposure-response studies.\n\n-  Collaborate with leading experts in coral reef science and conservation.\n\n-  Make meaningful contributions to the understanding of reef resilience and restoration strategies.\n\n-  Develop critical skills in data analysis, scientific writing, and interdisciplinary communication.\n\n\n\n**Mentor:** The mentor for this opportunity is Jeff Guyon ([jeff.guyon@noaa.gov](mailto:jeff.guyon@noaa.gov)). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: October 2024.** Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of NOAA and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n**Participant Stipend:** The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.\n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and NOAA. Participants do not become employees of NOAA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\n\n\n**Questions:** If you have questions about the application process please email [NOAA@orau.org](mailto:NOAA@orau.org) and include the reference code for this opportunity.\"",

        "description": "\"The new opportunityThe scope of this funding opportunity includes areas where genomic technologies are used to help achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and reduce the carbon footprint of Canada s agriculture and food production system. Projects should seek solutions that will increase the value created by production systems without increasing greenhouse gas emissions or amplifying negative impacts on the natural environment.\n\n\n\nThe Initiative will fund a portfolio of Interdisciplinary Challenge Team (ICT) projects that will be supported, coordinated and connected through cross-cutting programs in knowledge mobilization, data coordination and implementation. This portfolio approach allows the benefits from one solution to be applied to other food production systems or supply chains such that the impacts can cascade throughout the broader food system.\n\n\n\nKnowledge mobilization and implementation will be critical components of the Initiative. The projects within the portfolio will intentionally and regularly connect, convene and learn from each other to drive greater collective impact.\n\n\n\nTo that end, this Initiative will fund two cross-cutting coordination Hubs: the Data Coordination and Collaboration Hub (hereafter  the Data Hub ), which will focus on data, and the Knowledge Mobilization and Implementation Coordination Hub (hereafter  the KMIC Hub ), which will focus on knowledge mobilization and implementation. These Hubs will provide administrative, technical and coordination leadership to the project portfolio with a focus on:\n\n\n\n-    Intentionally connecting projects across the ICT portfolio.\n\n-    Supporting the coordination and alignment of portfolio activities across projects.\n\n-    Engaging stakeholders and end users at the portfolio level.\n\n-    Adding value to project outputs.\n\n-    Addressing gaps to create portfolio coherence in achieving impacts.\n\nThe KMIC Hub will possess broad and specific knowledge, skills and expertise in genomics in society (GIS)-a field that encompasses the environmental, economic, ethical, legal and social aspects of genomics (GE3LS) research as well as skills in stakeholder relations, partnership development, project management, stakeholder and end-user engagement, policy and regulation, economics, and implementation science. These skills and knowledge areas will equip the KMIC Hub to lead and coordinate cross-cutting GE3LS research and activities at the portfolio level and to launch and manage other knowledge mobilization activities that will help drive the adoption of genomic solutions and mobilize knowledge to help the portfolio deliver net carbon reduction.\n\n\n\nNotably, the KMIC Hub will focus initially on developing mechanisms and structures to enable the ICT teams to connect with the Hub. The Hub will work with ICTs to refine, co-create and harmonize project-specific knowledge mobilization and implementation plans into a single unified portfolio plan. This plan should describe an ambitious yet practical vision of what a Canadian KMIC Hub for climate genomics could be and how it will work across the portfolio of projects to support Canada s goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and to reduce the carbon footprint of its agriculture and food production system.\n\n\n\nIt will be critically important for the KMIC and Data Hubs to work together to coordinate their activities across the portfolio, informing each other s data and knowledge mobilization portfolio-level strategies. Both Hubs will require formal mechanisms and structures to ensure coordination and co-creation of work across the portfolio and with each other. Governance structures will support this. Genome Canada and the relevant Genome Centres will have ongoing, direct relationships with the Hubs to drive strategic objectives in knowledge mobilization and data coordination.\n\n\n\n**2. Objectives**\n\nThe objective of this funding opportunity is to support a single pan-Canadian team that will develop and implement a portfolio-level knowledge mobilization and implementation plan for Genome Canada s Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative. The team will coordinate knowledge mobilization and implementation activities to ensure that research and investments produce the intended impacts and outcomes. Consistent with the overall Initiative objective, this will include undertaking key GE3LS research at the portfolio level and advancing genomic technologies and policies that have the potential to measurably mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration.\"",

Investigators who are new to the conduct of clinical trials are welcome to apply to this NOFO and participate in clinical trial research, but they are encouraged to identify appropriate mentors and to establish the right personnel compositions for the clinical trial teams.\n\n\n\n**Research Objectives**  \n\n\n\nThis NOFO is applicable to a broad range of clinical trial evaluations designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in areas of common and unmet need. Each application should represent the applicant's or applicants' interest(s) and competencies, as well as the science related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients through well-designed and executed clinical trials. In addition, strategies to assess feasibility can include a novel area of investigation, new experimental systems, and/or existing technologies in a new area.\n\n\n\nAlthough the rationale must be supported by preliminary data, the proposed clinical investigations may include study designs, methods, and interventions that are not themselves innovative but address important questions and/or unmet needs.\n\n\n\n**General Areas of Research**\n\n\n\nThis NOFO is applicable to a broad range of clinical trial evaluations that improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in areas of common and unmet need. Potential areas of research may include, but are not limited to, the clinical evaluation of new or improved anticancer drugs and biologics, including immunotherapies, new or improved imaging technologies and surgical interventions, novel approaches to radiation therapy, and incorporation of complementary and alternative medicine approaches to treatment. The research component may include the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices in combination with standard care therapies including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or any combination of these modalities. Additional research aims can be proposed as part of the overall research plan provided it includes at least 1 clinical trial to be completed within the project period.\n\n\n\n**Examples of projects appropriate to this NOFO include applications with the** ***primary intent*** **of conducting early phase clinical trial(s)** for testing the efficacy, safety, clinical management, and/or implementation of novel therapeutic or diagnostic interventions, such as drugs, biologics, vaccines, stem cells, medicinal natural products, clinical laboratory tests, imaging agents, imaging devices, or image-guided therapies.\n\n\n\n*Applicants may, for example, propose to conduct an early phase clinical trial that:*\n\n\n\n-  Evaluates the dosing, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and effectiveness of novel anticancer drugs, biologics, immunotherapeutics (e.g., adoptive cell transfer therapies), and their combinations as well as imaging agents or other interventions;\n\n-  Tests approved agents and combinations for new indications;\n\n-  Evaluates new or improved image-guided interventions, radiation modalities, means of delivery, or combinations with novel agents;\n\n-  Tests imaging probes or quantitative approaches incorporated into commercially available imaging instrumentation (e.g., positron emission tomography [PET], single photon-emission computed tomography [SPECT], magnetic resonance [MR] imaging, computed tomography [CT], ultrasound [US], optical imaging, and photoacoustic imaging [PAI]);\n\n-  Assesses tools, methods, devices, and instruments that can perform at the molecular, cellular, and organ levels;\n\n-  Investigates multi-parametric imaging approaches and biomarker detection assays including radiomics, radiogenomics, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics;\n\n-  Evaluates imaging or laboratory biomarker activity, pharmacodynamic response, target engagement, dose-response trends;\n\n-  Selects or ranks the best potential interventions, technologies, and/or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, safety data, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., a futility trial);\n\n-  Conducts exploratory investigational new drug (IND) and/or investigational device exemption (IDE) studies (visit the FDA's website to obtain guidance documents on [INDs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application), [IDE](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/investigational-device-exemption-ide)s, and [Clinical Trials](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-trials-guidance-documents); and\n\n-  Evaluates integrative medicine approaches such as diets, nutrients, herbs, bioactive food components, pre/probiotics, microbiota practices, and mind-body interventions (e.g., acupuncture, exercise, meditation, and sleep) to improve standard of care or investigational therapeutics.\n\n\n\nResearch approaches should focus on interventions with outcome measures that contribute to the improvement of knowledge regarding mechanism of action or resistance, therapeutic index, prediction of response, standard-of-care practices, and/or quality of life. Research that combines expertise in more than one clinical research area (e.g., the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices) is also welcome.\n\n\n\nPrior to submitting applications to this NOFO, applicants are encouraged to review the [NIH clinical trial case studies](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/case-studies.htm) and [frequently asked questions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/faq_clinical_trial_definition.htm) to determine if their clinical study meets the NIH definition of a clinical trial. Applicants should also consult with the Scientific/Research contacts for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application. Early contact (at least 12 weeks prior to submission) is encouraged. This period provides an opportunity for the NCI staff to discuss the scope and goals, and to provide information and guidance to the applicants.\n\n\n\n**Type of Clinical trials to be supported by this NOFO**  \n\n\n\nClinical trials proposed must meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial (see [NOT-OD-15-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html)) and should contribute to the advancement of evidence-based medicine/practice and the sciences that support it. Applicants may propose to conduct an early phase trial by itself, or in combination with other non-clinical trial research aims as appropriate. The NOFO will support the conduct of investigator-initiated oncologic intervention research at all early stages, from early mechanistic research and intervention development (e.g., stage 0 and/or I) through implementation and cost-effectiveness research. NCI funds may be used to support single-site, multi-site, hypothesis-driven, pathway-related, exploratory/feasibility and pragmatic trials (as defined below) designed to improve the management of care for patients with cancer. The trial design should be appropriate for the hypothesis to be tested. This NOFO also supports randomized phase II trials that can be performed within the temporal and fiscal limits of this program announcement. In addition, applicants may find the NIH-FDA *Clinical Trial e-Protocol Writing Tool and Templates* helpful in preparing phase II clinical trial protocols conducted under an FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Application. These web-based resources, which is optional for use here, can be found at [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/protocol-template.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/protocol-template.htm). \n\n\n\nNote that **phase III clinical trials will not be accepted** through this NOFO.\n\n\n\n*Description of the type of clinical trials that can be supported include:*\n\n\n\n-  Single site clinical trial(s): Early phase trials where the protocol is implemented by one investigational site that conducts and coordinates the protocol. While a single site clinical trial may enroll participants from multiple locations/clinics within a geographic area, those participants will receive an intervention or undergo outcome assessments under the direction and oversight of one research team at one investigational site.\n\n-  Multi-site clinical trial(s): Early phase trials that recruit study subjects from two or more geographically distinct enrollment sites, or centers. The sites are usually distinct in other characteristics (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic, or clinical). Study protocols are followed at these sites.\n\n-  Mechanistic clinical trial(s): Hypothesis-driven interventional studies (i.e., early phase trials) focused on basic and/or translational, discovery research on the biology and pathophysiology of cancer or the mechanism of action of an intervention.\n\n-  Feasibility clinical trial(s): Early phase trials that propose to break new ground and/or extend previous discoveries toward new directions and/or applications.\n\n-  Pragmatic trial(s): Early phase trials that test an intervention under the usual clinical conditions in which it will be applied, while explanatory trials do so under more idealized circumstances.\n\n-  Ancillary clinical trial(s): Early phase trials that address research questions related to ongoing trials but are distinct from the primary/secondary objectives of the parent study. An [ancillary clinical](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2019/01/08/is-my-ancillary-study-considered-a-clinical-trial/) trial is an independent trial that includes an additional intervention prospectively assigned to patients or a subpopulation of patients within a larger trial. For helpful examples, see case studies [42b and 42c](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/case-studies.htm).\n\n-  Pharmacodynamic trial(s): Early phase trials that link outcomes to measurements on pre- and post-treatment specimens to test hypotheses about therapeutic mechanisms based on pre-clinical data.\n\n-  Biomarker-driven trial(s): Early phase trials that test predictive or prognostic biomarker findings obtained from pilot trials.\n\n-  Co-clinical trial(s): Early phase trials that involve patients and in parallel (or sequentially) animal or human-in-animal models of cancer that mirror the genetics and biology of the patients malignancies or pre-cancerous lesions. The co-clinical trial should include either a therapeutic goal (e.g., the prediction, staging, and/or measurement of tumor response to therapies) or an early diagnostic goal.\n\n-  HIV and AIDS related trials: Any of the above listed trial types conducted in individuals with an underlying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO**  \n\n\n\nApplications proposing these kinds of studies will not be considered responsive. Applications not responsive to this NOFO will not be reviewed.\n\n\n\n-  Investigator-initiated phase III cancer-related medical/oncologic intervention and/or investigational imaging clinical trials as specified in the NCI policy for R01 and P01 activity codes found in Notice [NOT-CA-13-012](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-13-012.html).\n\n-  Applications involving only animal and/or in vitro studies that do not complement a trial are not appropriate; however, applications proposing both animal work and/or in vitro studies and a clinical trial are appropriate.\n\n-  Applications proposing only observational studies that do not meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial. These studies may be submitted as R01s to the NIH Parent R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed.\n\n-  Clinical trials to investigate behavioral interventions without a therapeutic endpoint are not supported under this announcement but could be submitted to the NCI investigator-initiated clinical trials NOFO sponsored by [DCP](https://dcp.cancer.gov/) and [DCCPS](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/).\n\n-  Planned or ongoing clinical trials performed by NCI-funded networks and special programs (e.g., National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN), and Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs).\n\n-  Clinical trial applications requesting to utilize the NCTN and/or ETCTN infrastructure and/or resources that do not have NCI prior approval. These programs operate under a cooperative agreement in which NCI has the responsibility for final review and approval of all protocols and subsequent amendments as well as the use of biospecimens collected in association with the Network trials. Applicants must consult the appropriate Principal Investigator of the NCTN Group or the ETCTN Lead Academic Organization to determine if NCI approval has been obtained for a potential submission.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the [Research Methods Resources](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/) website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\"",

        "description": "\"1.Scope of Program \n1.1 Overview\n\n\n\nNASA is partnering with the European Space Agency (ESA) on the ESA-led Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave observatory planned for launch in the early 2030s. LISA will detect gravitational waves in the milli-Hz band, opening a new window to study the Universe. LISA will measure gravitational radiation from a variety of astrophysical sources including the mergers of massive black holes, the capture of stellar-remnant black holes by galactic center black holes, close compact binaries in our own galaxy, and other potential sources. More information about the LISA mission can be found at https://lisa.nasa.gov.\n\n\n\nNASA's specific contributions to LISA are the subject of ongoing discussions with ESA, but are expected to include elements of the instrument, elements of the spacecraft, and aspects of science data analysis and science interpretation, including potential Guest Investigator activities. While the development of hardware and ground-segment infrastructure is supported by NASA through the NASA LISA Study Office (NLSO) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, this ROSES element concerns the support of U.S.-based investigators for developing tools and techniques for the analysis and interpretation of LISA data.\n\n\n\n1.2\tProgram Objectives\n\n\n\nThe LISA Preparatory Science (LPS) program has been created to provide support for U.S. investigators to conduct activities that contribute to furthering the eventual science yield of LISA. It is not intended as a vehicle for funding specific U.S. contributions to the LISA instrument or science ground segment, or to develop concepts for other missions outside of LISA. Proposals to the LPS program may request support to:\n\n\n\n Perform high-fidelity simulations of the expected waveforms for LISA sources and assessing their impact on LISA's science return;\n\n\n\n Develop data analysis and statistical techniques useful for the extraction of scientific measurements from LISA data (e.g., parameter estimators, etc.);\n\n\n\n Refine and expand on LISA's capabilities to conduct specific astrophysical investigations and evaluate LISA s potential contributions in the context of the broader astrophysical landscape;\n\n\n\n Conduct astrophysics investigations that demonstrably prepare for the analysis and interpretation of the LISA data.\n\n\n\nNote that the NLSO is responsible for NASA's direct contributions to both the instrument and science ground segment. More information on the current activities of the NLSO can be found at https://lisa.nasa.gov/teamActivities.html. Proposers must ensure that the proposed investigations do not duplicate these activities. Proposals also must not duplicate previously funded LPS projects; for a list and brief description of prior LPS projects see https://lisa.nasa.gov/LPSprogram.html.\n\n\n\nProposals to the LPS program may not:\n\n\n\n Address topics that are predominantly theoretical in nature. Such proposals may be directed to the mission-specific programs or the Astrophysics Theory Program (ATP) described in Program Element D.4 of ROSES-2021;\n\n\n\n Consist primarily of data reduction or analysis of archival data other than that in direct support of LISA-centric investigations. Such proposals may be directed, as appropriate, to the mission-specific programs or the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) described in Program Element D.2 of ROSES-2022;\n\n\n\n Consist primarily of new astronomical observations. Such proposals may be directed to the mission-specific Guest Observer programs;\n\n\n\n Propose to develop technologies or experimental concepts for LISA;\n\n\n\n Request support for organizing and/or hosting scientific meetings. Such proposals may be directed to the Topical Workshops, Symposia, and Conferences (TWSC) program described in Program Element F.2 of ROSES-2022; or\n\n\n\n Request support for substantial computing facilities or resources.\n\n\n\n1.3\tAvailability of High-End Computational Resources\n\n\n\nThose investigators whose research requires high-performance computing should refer to the ROSES Summary of Solicitation, Section I(d), \"NASA-provided High-End Computing Resources.\" This section describes the opportunity for the successful procedure that proposers must follow to apply for computing time on either of two NASA computing facilities at the Goddard Space Flight Center s Computational and Information Sciences and Technology Office or at the Ames Research Center s Advanced Supercomputing Division.\"",

        "title": "\"Dear Colleague Letter: Assessing Societal and Economic Impacts of Place-Based Innovation\"",
        "description": "\"Dear Colleagues:\nWith this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), the National Science Foundation's (NSF s) Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) announces its intention to invest in EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposals that will advance the state of the art in assessing the societal and economic impacts of place-based innovation. The subsequent EAGER awards will advance research that addresses gaps in publicly available data and associated knowledge to adequately and appropriately benchmark activities in place-based innovation grounded in integrating research and development (R&D), translation, and workforce development (WFD), with emphases on how we leverage the full spectrum of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) as well as leveraging of cross-sector partnerships. This DCL invites transdisciplinary teams to develop [convergent](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/learn-about-convergence-research) and potentially [transformative](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/learn/research-types/transformative-research) research proposals to address these gaps, and thereby increase the understanding of, and data surrounding, the elements of a regional innovation ecosystem and the various ways in which they interact and intersect with one another.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\n\nThe [NSF Regional Innovation Engines](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines) (NSF Engines) program was authorized in the [CHIPS and Science Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346/text) (Section 10388) to:\n\n\n\n1.  advance multidisciplinary, collaborative, use-inspired and translational research, technology development, in key technology focus areas;\n\n2.  address regional, national, societal, or geostrategic challenges;\n\n3.  leverage the expertise of multi-disciplinary and multi-sector partners, including partners from private industry, nonprofit organizations, and civil society organizations; and\n\n4.  support the development of scientific, innovation, entrepreneurial, and STEM educational capacity within the region of a given NSF Engine to grow and sustain regional innovation.\n\n\n\nThe NSF Engines program aims to fund regional coalitions of partnering organizations to catalyze technology and science-based regional innovation ecosystems. Each NSF Engine is focused on addressing specific aspects of a major national, societal and/or geostrategic challenge that are of significant interest in the NSF Engine s defined region of service. Each NSF Engine will carry out an integrated and comprehensive set of activities spanning use-inspired research, translation to practice, entrepreneurship, and WFD to nurture and accelerate regional industries. In addition, each NSF Engine is expected to embody a culture of innovation and have a demonstrated, intense, and meaningful focus on improving diversity throughout its regional science and technology ecosystem. The first-ever cohort of NSF Engines is expected to be announced in late 2023. Monitoring, assessing, and evaluating the progress individual NSF Engines make in R&D, translation, WFD, DEIA, and leveraging cross-sector partnerships will be critical to understanding the establishment and evolution of regional innovation ecosystems, including the specific gating factors that determine progression through the nascent, emergent, growth, and mature phases defined in the NSF Engines [Broad Agency Announcement](https://sam.gov/opp/68c9f585eed7457a9c1c1fe5dd6ae9a2/view).\n\n\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n\n\nGiven the limited publicly available data and knowledge to benchmark place-based innovation in general, particularly that which is grounded in the integration of R&D, translation, WFD, DEIA, and leveraging of cross-sector partnerships, NSF seeks to invest in new research that advances the state of the art. For instance, there is a gap in the understanding of, and data on, the amount of time projects spend in the R&D and translation phases, and the amount of time and investments needed to bring a product from conception to market availability. Similarly, there is a lack of understanding and data on whether and how different WFD approaches impact participants  short-, medium-, and long-term career trajectories and future earnings. An additional component of complexity is that data and benchmarks are likely to vary by geographical region as well as technology. NSF s investments through this DCL may therefore address the availability of data, benchmarks, and thresholds necessary for the assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of place-based innovation activities in R&D, translation, WFD, DEIA, and cross-sector partnerships with respect to the development of regional innovation ecosystems. This work will in turn directly inform the NSF Engines program and associated investments.\n\n\n\nEAGER proposals require the submission of a Concept Outline that describes at a high level the research to be pursued, how it will address the challenge described above, and the expected outcomes if the research is successful. An EAGER proposal may only be submitted after consideration of the Concept Outline by an NSF Program Officer. A minimum of one PI and one co-PI must be associated with a Concept Outline. Participation of economists and/or social scientists is strongly encouraged. Concept Outlines are strictly limited in length to three pages plus a half-page justification of the estimated budget, for a total of three and one-half pages, including references. The Concept Outline must describe the research idea with a clear explanation of why it is innovative, potentially transformative, or otherwise potentially impactful. Reasons why the concept is appropriate for EAGER funding must be provided in a separate paragraph, e.g., the proposed work involves radically different approaches, applies new expertise, and/or engages novel interdisciplinary perspectives; in short, the proposed work constitutes a high-risk, high-reward and transdisciplinary activity that is unsuitable for submission to existing NSF programs through the \"regular\" proposal submission process.\"",

        "description": " Fire Prevention and Safety Grants - FP&S Activity\"***a. Overview***\n\nThe Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) Grant Program (hereafter referred to as the FP&S Program) is one of three grant programs that constitute the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) focus on enhancing the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and fire-related hazards. The FP&S Program provides financial assistance directly to eligible fire departments, national, regional, state, local, tribal and non-profit organizations such as academic (e.g., universities), public health, occupational health, and injury prevention institutions for fire prevention programs and supporting firefighter health and safety research and development such as clinical studies that address behavioral, social science, and cultural research. Examples of research and development grants that have been funded under this program can be found at Fire Prevention and Safety | FEMA.gov.\n\n\n\nThe FP&S Program has awarded approximately $770 million in grant funding to provide critically needed resources to strengthen community fire prevention programs and enable scientific research on innovations that improve firefighter safety, health, and wellness.\n\n\n\nThe FP&S Program is part of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by Congress and implemented by DHS. Among the five basic homeland security missions noted in the DHS Strategic Plan the FP&S Program supports the goal to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience. In awarding grants, the FEMA Administrator is required to consider:\n\n\n\n  The findings and recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Panel;\n\n  The degree to which an award will reduce deaths, injuries, and property damage by reducing the risks associated with fire-related and other hazards; and\n\n  The extent of an applicant's need for an FP&S Program grant and the need to protect the United States as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe 2018-2022 FEMA Strategic Plan creates a shared vision for the field of emergency management and sets an ambitious, yet achievable, path forward to unify and further professionalize emergency management across the country. The FP&S Program supports the goal of Readying the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters. We invite all of our stakeholders and partners to also adopt these priorities and join us in building a stronger Agency and a more prepared and resilient nation.\n\n\n\nb. **Objectives** The objectives of the FP&S Program are to provide critically needed resources to carry out fire prevention education and training, fire code enforcement, fire/arson investigation, firefighter safety and health programming, prevention efforts, and research and development.\n\n\n\nc. **Priorities** Information on program priorities and objectives for the FY 2021 FP&S Program can be found in Appendix B - Programmatic Information and Priorities of this NOFO.\n\n\n\n11. **Performance Measures**\n\nThe grant recipient is required to collect data to allow FEMA to measure performance of the awarded grant in support of the FP&S Program metrics, which are tied to the programmatic objectives and priorities. In order to measure performance, FEMA may request information throughout the period of performance. In its final performance report submitted at closeout, the recipient must submit sufficient information to demonstrate it has met the performance goal as stated in its award. FEMA will measure the recipient's performance of the grant by comparing the number of items, supplies, projects, and activities needed and requested in its application with the number of items, supplies, projects, and activities acquired and delivered by the end of the period of performance using the following programmatic metrics:\n\n\n\n**a. FP&S Activity**\n\n  Community Risk Reduction:\n\n        1. Decrease in fire incidents per 1,000 residents in target population\n\n        2. Decrease in fire deaths per 1,000 residents in target population\n\n        3. Percent of whole community population trained\n\n        4. Percent of target population trained\n\n        5. Local number of lives saved\n\n  Code Enforcement/Awareness:\n\n        1. Decrease in percentage of total fire losses occurring in inspectable occupancies\n\n        2. Decrease in structural fires per 1,000 residents of inspectable occupancies\n\n        3. Decrease in fire deaths per 1,000 residents of inspectable occupancies\n\n        4. Decrease in inspectable property structure fires with at least $25,000 in loss\n\n  Fire and Arson Investigation:\n\n        1. Increase in percentage of fires where cause is determined\n\n        2. Increase in arson arrest and conviction rates\n\n  National/State/Regional Programs and Projects:\n\n        1. Number of firefighters trained\"",

Applicant's Adjusted Gross Household Income reported for 2022 Federal Income Tax Purposes must not have exceeded $100,000. Free workshops, Free Schwab Brokerage Accounts, and Free Study Abroad provide recipients with a practical understanding of important life skills not typically covered in the school curriculum. Recipients graduating college while in the Hagan Scholarship Program can apply for a Hagan Graduate Scholarship good for up to four additional consecutive semesters.\n\n\n\nHagan Scholars have attended over 500 colleges and universities located in 48 states.\n\n\n\n**Description of Scholarship**\n\n\n\nThe Hagan Scholarship provides up to $7,500 each semester for up to 8 consecutive semesters, workshops to learn important life skills not typically covered in the college curriculum, funds to purchase college essentials, an HSF Schwab Brokerage Account to manage, funds to study and travel abroad, and the opportunity to extend the Hagan Scholarship to obtain a graduate or professional degree.\n\n\n\n1.  The disbursement amount each semester will be determined by HSF by taking the Total Cost of Attendance including tuition, fees, room, board, books, supplies, personal and transportation costs; then, deducting the total dollar amount of ALL scholarships, awards, grants, waivers, institution provided work-study, and one-half of the recipient's EFC. The EFC does not have to be paid; it is used only to determine the disbursement amount.\n\n2.  The disbursement amount will be adjusted each semester to offset the expiration or loss of other scholarships, awards, grants, waivers, institution provided work-study, and changes in the recipient s EFC.\n\n3.  The Hagan Scholarship is renewable for up to seven additional consecutive semesters if the recipient fulfills the scholarship criteria and mandatory workshop responsibilities. Funding of the Hagan Scholarship will cease upon graduation from college or after earning 130 credit hours, whichever first occurs. In such event, recipients will continue managing their HSF Schwab Account and fulfill all other scholarship criteria until their Award Year Class graduates college. To receive funding after graduation or after earning 130 credit hours, recipients must apply for and be awarded a Hagan Graduate Scholarship.\n\n4.  First year recipients receive $1,000 prior to college enrollment to purchase essential items for college not covered by the scholarship; items such as a computer, cell phone, clothing, school supplies, and bedding.\n\n5.  Second year recipients will open a Personal Schwab Brokerage Account. After the account is opened HSF will deposit $100 in the account and provide each recipient with an HSF Schwab Brokerage Account to manage until graduation. HSF funds managed by each recipient will be $10,000 the second year, $15,000 the third year, and $20,000 the fourth year.\n\n6.  Third year recipients who have achieved a 3.50 CGPA are eligible for an all-expense paid study and travel abroad experience worth up to $8,000. Or the funds can be used to study abroad the second semester of the third year in college.\n\n7.  Recipients who will graduate college while in the Hagan Scholarship Program can apply for a Hagan Graduate Scholarship the semester prior to graduation, good for up to four additional consecutive semesters to attend graduate school or a professional school receiving up to $7,500 each semester. Recipients must enroll in college as a full-time graduate student or professional student the first semester following receipt of their undergraduate degree.\n\n8.  Recipients must work 240 hours from January 1 each year until commencement of the fall semester in college. Work can be performed at recipient discretion. Employment must be regularly scheduled work performed under supervision for compensation. Work can be full-time during the summer and/or part-time work.\n\n9.  There is no application fee or processing fee.\n\n\n\nRecipients of a scholarship will be selected on an objective and non-discriminatory basis, regardless of applicant s race, creed, color, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or sex.\n\n\n\n*Decisions made by HSF are final and not subject to appeal.

Priority will be given to support for a child determined to be most likely to benefit from alternate therapies, whose family or support team do not have the means for such treatments.\n\n\n\nThe fund s conditions were amended in 2014 to also allow for grants to be made: for initiatives aimed to educate brain-injury survivors, caretakers, health professionals and rehabilitation teams, including sharing of success stories that raise awareness with the public including Acquired Brain Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury survivors, their families and medical professionals; and to support research and development initiatives which may help gather and advance scientific evidence for promising new rehabilitation options for children and others recovering from acquired/traumatic brain injury and related injuries\"",

        "description": "\"You may apply for an **Introductory Grant** by November 1 if your organization has never received a Clowes Fund competitive grantIntroductory Grants are operating grants for $40K paid over two years ($20K per year). We use the Introductory Application to identify promising organizations that address our Immigrant Services and Workforce Development priorities, with a particular emphasis on organizations with budgets less than $2.5 million (seek program officer guidance if your budget exceeds this amount).\n\n\n\n**What we fund**\n\n\n\nThe Fund primarily awards multi-year operating grants that focus on socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals through Immigrant Services, Workforce Development, Arts Education and K-12 Education. In 2022, the Fund committed to making multi-year operating grants the norm rather than exception. Relationships are at the center of our work, and strong relationships with grantee partners will continue to guide us.  \n\n  \n\nTransparency is core to strong relationships, so we are compelled to share that fewer than 10% of Introductory Applications will result in an Introductory Grant. The likelihood of funding is much higher for returning grantees seeking Continuation Grants.\n\n\n\n**Introductory Grants are limited to Immigrant Services and Workforce Development**, and most Introductory Grants are awarded to organizations with operating budgets less than $2.5 million. Priorities include:\n\n\n\n1.  **Immigrant Services**: Addressing the economic, linguistic, legal, and mental and emotional hurdles that immigrants, refugees and asylees and their children face during integration into the United States' society and its economy. Learn more about our immigrant services priorities on the [Community Grantee Feedback](https://www.clowesfund.org/community-grantee-feedback) page.\n\n    \n\n2.  **Workforce Development**: Ensuring that all individuals have access to both job skills training and the support services necessary to enable them to participate fully in the economic life of their communities. In addition, we support youth development efforts that prevent students (ages 15 to 25) from dropping out of school and assist in their return to school or their pursuit of an alternate course to economic self-sufficiency.\"",

        "description": " Regional Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) FY2022 - 2. RISA teams for the following regions new to the RISA program: U.S. Caribbean and Central Midwest\"A.  Program Objective\n\n\n\nThe Regional Integrated Science and Assessments (RISA) Program resides in the Climate Program Office's (CPO) Climate and Societal Interactions Division (CSI). CSI has traditionally been a home for high-impact science, catalyzing some of the earliest U.S. government investments in regionally scaled, societally relevant, interdisciplinary climate research and engagement focused on reducing vulnerability and risk through the use of climate knowledge and information. Today, CSI continues to work with partners to enhance community and national resilience in the face of climatic changes, through human-centered research and engagement activities designed to connect innovative science directly to complex and dynamic preparedness, adaptation, and resilience challenges. Programs managed by CSI are a key component of NOAA's cutting-edge research enterprise, which has evolved over time to include the private sector, NGOs, interdisciplinary teams, and the social sciences at large. Moving forward, the CSI Division is reorganizing to include the new Adaptation Science Program (AdSci) as well as continuing to support the RISA Program, in order to streamline, expand, and build upon past investments, and address emerging topics in adaptation science-a critical cornerstone to a more resilient future.\n\n\n\nThe RISA Program \n\nThe RISA program builds relationships that help local decision makers and researchers collaborate on adapting to climate change. Through regionally-focused and interdisciplinary research and engagement teams, RISA expands the Nation's capacity to adapt and become resilient to extreme weather events and climate change. RISA teams accomplish this through applied and co-developed research and partnerships with communities. A central tenet of the RISA program is that learning about climate adaptation and resilience is facilitated by and sustained across a wide range of experts, practitioners, and the public. As such, the RISA program supports a network of people, prioritizing wide participation in learning by doing, learning through adapting, and managing risk with uncertain information.\n\n\n\nEarly decades of the program focused on understanding the use of climate information at regional scales (e.g., through experimental seasonal outlooks), improving predictions and scenarios, building capacity for drought early warning, and advancing the science of climate impact assessments. Much of this work is now the focus of other federal programs. More recently, emphasis has shifted to address the growing urgency to advance approaches that tackle the complex societal issues surrounding adaptation planning, implementation, and building community resilience that incorporate the intersection of multiple natural hazards and social stressors. To do so, RISA continues to prioritize collaborative approaches that incorporate multiple knowledge sources and integrate social, physical, and natural science, resulting in long-term support of and increased capacity for communities. In addition, RISA supports cutting-edge social science on the impacts of climate change on communities, challenges and opportunities for adaptation, and inclusive methods of engagement. As the adaptation community in the United States advances and evolves, RISA seeks to support new creative, solution-oriented approaches that are both responsive to communities and that integrate across silos of scientific knowledge and expertise. Central to achieving the RISA mission are:\n\n\n\n-Regional Relevance, Local Expertise\n\n-Integrated Scientific Approaches\n\n-Knowledge-to-Action Partnerships\n\n-A National Network of Resilience Researchers and Adaptation Science Specialists\n\n\n\nThe RISA program encourages applicants and awardees to support the principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion when writing their proposals and while performing their work. Ensuring justice and equity means paying particular attention to populations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which are often low-income communities, historically marginalized communities, indigenous and tribal communities, those already overburdened by pollution, those who lack economic or social opportunity, and people facing disenfranchisement. Diversity here is defined as a collection of individual attributes that together help organizations achieve objectives. Inclusion is defined as a culture that connects each person to the larger organizing structure. Promoting justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion improves the creativity, productivity, and vitality of the communities in which the program engages.\n\n\n\nB.  Program Priorities\n\n\n\nThrough this announcement, the RISA program is seeking applications for four competitions in FY 2022. Prior to submitting applications, investigators are highly encouraged to learn more about the RISA program at cpo.noaa.gov/RISA, as well as program priorities for FY 2022. This information, along with contact details, is provided in an information sheet that can be found at the following website: https://cpo.noaa.gov/Grants.\n\n\n\nThe four competitions covered by this announcement are as follows:\n\n\n\nCompetitions 1 and 2: RISA Teams\n\n\n\nIn competitions 1 and 2, the RISA program is soliciting applications to support up to one full RISA team to conduct research and engagement in each of the regions mentioned below. In Competition 1, the program is accepting applications for regions currently covered by the RISA Network-West and Southwest. In competition 2, the program is accepting applications for regions new to the RISA network-U.S. Caribbean and Central Midwest.\n\nA maximum of one RISA team will be funded per region. With each team, we are aiming to build on-the-ground expertise, capacity, and trust-building within the specified region. The regions listed below and their states are priorities and guidelines for coverage, i.e. applicants are permitted to go beyond the borders of the states listed below within a region only IF there is strong justification for determining alternative boundaries. For geographic regions with coastal areas, applicants must balance issues for both inland and coastal areas; proposals focused exclusively on coastal areas will not be deemed relevant. Please see the corresponding information sheet for details on how to determine regional coverage. The following are the regions being competed:\n\n1. West: California, Nevada\n\n2. Southwest: Arizona, New Mexico\n\n3. U.S. Caribbean: Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands\n\n4. Central Midwest: Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska\n\n\n\nApplicants applying to Competitions 1 and 2 are also eligible to apply for the optional Small-Grants Component (see below). NOTE: the small-grants component will only be awarded to teams that are successful in the core work of Competitions 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nFor both competitions 1 and 2, proposals should focus on multiple societal issues relevant to that region, and develop a set of interconnected projects related to these issues. Areas of focus for a RISA team should be guided by collaborative engagements and iterative assessment of opportunities and needs between RISA team members and regional partners and institutions, and should reflect current program objectives described in section I.A.\n\n\n\nTeams should aim to balance scientific inquiry with engagement practices. Proposals must include a diversity of projects where some might meet the need for more actionable climate information, while others might support increased awareness and outreach, improve methods for adaptive management and implementation, compare climate impacts across communities, evaluate adaptation approaches, or support relevant decision making processes (from conceptualization through analysis of implementation strategies). Social science should be a cornerstone of these projects, ensuring that analysis is grounded in understanding of attitudes, behaviors, institutional processes, political norms, social barriers, etc. Projects might also include some areas of focus that are relevant across multiple regions and contexts and that have potential for scalability and national impact. Applicants should also consider Notice of Federal Funding Page 7 of 32\n\nmechanisms for conducting research under conditions that may change over the five-year period, as well as approaches for team management and decision making that allow for flexibility in adjusting projects in response to emerging regional concerns and events. Every proposal should include evaluation metrics and components both as a research method to identify successful adaptation approaches, but also as a means for ensuring active management to achieve project goals.\n\n\n\nAll projects should incorporate the principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. To do so, applicants should consider the following factors when addressing team composition, team management and decision making, focus areas for research and engagement, geographies, and approaches employed in the proposed work.\n\n\n\n- The vulnerabilities and disproportionate impacts of climate change on frontline communities including economically disadvantaged communities, historically marginalized communities, indigenous and tribal communities, and rural communities.\n\n- Communities, towns, or neighborhoods under-resourced and underserved by technical, financial, and/or human resources (e.g. communities too small to qualify for FEMA grants) to address climate risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n- The role of researchers and practitioners in carrying out work in ways that acknowledge existing legacies of social and environmental inequities and supporting actions that address them, including but not limited to the inclusion and compensation of frontline community members in setting project priorities.\n\n- Regional diversity expressed in the team structure, roles and responsibilities, team decision making approaches, advisory boards composition, institutional roles, and broader networks and partnerships.\n\n- Team contributions to a diverse, next-generation climate adaptation workforce through training, mentorship, education, and other means and by engaging with students and early career professionals.\n\n\n\nCollaborative relationships within the region might include community-based organizations, universities serving diverse student populations (for example Minority Serving Institutions, two-year institutions etc.), state and local government entities, non-profit organizations, regional NOAA entities, existing climate networks such as the Regional Climate Centers, Climate Adaptation Science Centers, and USDA Climate Hubs, relevant federal agencies, and other groups involved in providing regional climate data and future projections, climate preparedness, adaptation, resilience, and mitigation efforts. Special consideration should be given to partnering with those communities or stakeholders within the regions for whom there is currently less direct engagement with climate information science and service providers, and/or for whom social and economic dimensions make vulnerability to climate impacts high and opportunities for recovery more challenging. NOTE: Teams new to RISA should consider activities early in the project to develop new partnerships, establish trust, and scope and identify opportunities for collaboration within their targeted region. See information sheet for additional details.\n\n\n\nWhere relevant and responsive to the needs of regional stakeholders, RISA activities might include some work on one or more of the following four climate-related risk areas being undertaken by the Climate Program Office: Extreme Heat, Coastal Inundation, Water Resources, and Marine Ecosystems. You can learn more about the risk areas here, https://cpo.noaa.gov/News/ArtMID/7875/ArticleID/1945/NOAA%E2%80%99s-Climate-Program-Office-launches-Climate-Risk-Areas-Initiative.  It is not anticipated that a proposed RISA team would work solely in these topic areas. RISA team priorities should be determined, and will be evaluated, based on the unique contexts and collaborators needs of their respective regions. In addition, applicants should consider these topics in the context of complex societal and climate stressors as well as frequently cascading or concurrent events.\n\n\n\nSmall-Grants Component:\n\nAs an optional, complementary component to the core RISA team work, NOAA will support teams who wish to conduct a small-grants competition within the scope of their five-year award. The purpose of this component is to directly connect the RISA team's core expertise with community-based organizations experienced in serving under-resourced frontline communities. The outcome of this partnership should benefit the community directly through the transfer of funds to build climate adaptation capacity, access to RISA expertise, and the establishment of foundational relationships for future collaboration.

Our program helps researchers excel in the increasingly complex and specialized environments required for future cancer research. Trainee research projects typically transcend the traditional boundaries separating the molecular and cellular, clinical, epidemiologic and social cancer sciences. Research project topics include studies of molecular and cellular mechanisms, detection and diagnosis, risk and behavioral factors that influence cancer incidence, development and assessment of treatment strategies, and studies of cancer outcomes. Projects with a focus on infectious agents clearly explain the relevance of the proposed studies to the incidence of cancers associated with that agent.  \n\n\n\nTrainees work with two mentors who provide distinct, complementary areas of expertise, for example, by studying basic molecular and cellular mechanisms in combination with epidemiological analyses, or by participating in clinical research studies while studying behavioral or environmental factors that influence therapeutic outcomes.  \n\n\n\nThe program supports 10 trainees each year. Eight of the trainees are appointed to a National Cancer Institute (NCI) training grant (T32 CA080416) and two additional trainees are supported by the Fred Hutch using funds provided by an endowment initiated by the Hearst Foundations.\n\n\n\nRequired programmatic activities include, but are not limited to, monthly trainee meetings, an annual colloquium and lunch with a program-hosted Current Biology Seminar Series speaker.\"",

Scientific User Facilities Division web page: http://science.osti.gov/bes/suf/\n\n\n\nProposed research must be responsive to a supported topic in one of the core research areas listed below.  Many of the core research areas limit early career Applications to a subset of topics within their regular research activities. In those cases, the intention is to rotate topics on an annual basis. Overarching research priorities for BES that are relevant to multiple core research areas are described in the bulleted list below.  The individual program descriptions further define research directions relevant to these priorities.\n\n\n\n-      **Clean Energy**: Research to provide understanding and scientific foundations for clean energy, including electrical and thermal energy storage; direct air capture of carbon dioxide; hydrogen production, storage, and use; solar energy conversion to electricity and fuels; and subsurface science.\n\n-      **Critical Materials/Minerals**: Research to understand the fundamental properties of rare earth and platinum group elements to improve separation and extraction processes and to enable discovery and design of alternates to critical materials that will reduce or eliminate their need.\n\n-      **Fundamental Science to Transform Manufacturing**: Research to understand fundamental chemical and materials processes for circular, clean, and scalable synthesis, processing, and fabrication; to advance transformational operando characterization and multiscale models and tools; and to co-design materials, processes, and products for functionality and use.\n\n-      **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)**: Research to advance the approaches and use of data science and AI/ML to accelerate fundamental research for the discovery of new chemical mechanisms and material systems with exceptional properties and function, and to apply these techniques for effective user facility operations and interpretation of massive data sets.\n\n-      **Quantum Information Science (QIS)**: Research to advance understanding of quantum phenomena in systems that could be used for quantum information science, and the use of quantum computing in chemical and materials sciences research.\n\n\n\n**(12) Gas Phase Chemical Physics (GPCP)**\n\nTechnical Contact: Wade Sisk, wade.sisk@science.doe.gov\n\n\n\nThis program supports research on fundamental gas-phase chemical processes that provide understanding and scientific foundations for clean energy and transformative manufacturing.\n\nResearch in this program explores chemical reactivity, kinetics and dynamics in the gas phase at the level of electrons, atoms, molecules and nanoparticles. A continuing goal of this program is to understand energy flow and reaction mechanisms in complex, nonequilibrium, gas-phase environments. A new goal for this program is to understand how these gas-phase processes can influence and be influenced by surface phenomena.\n\n\n\nThe major focus of research in this area is in five thrust areas: Light-Matter Interactions, Chemical Reactivity, Gas-Particle Interconversion, Gas-Surface Chemical Physics, and Ultrafast Imaging/Spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n1. Light-Matter Interactions includes research in the development and application of novel tools, such as molecular spectroscopy, for probing the nuclear and electronic structure of gas-phase molecules to enable chemical and physical analysis of heterogeneous and dynamic gas-phase environments and to understand the dynamic behavior of isolated molecules, such as energy flow (e.g., relaxation of excited states), nuclear rearrangements, and loss of coherence and entanglement. Applications are encouraged that develop automated methods based on AI/ML methods to facilitate the analysis of complex molecular spectra, or seek to improve the understanding of quantum phenomena in systems that could be used for quantum information science.\n\n(CLOSED)\n\n2. Chemical Reactivity comprises research in chemical kinetics and mechanisms, chemical dynamics, collisional energy transfer, and construction of, and calculations on, molecular potential energy surfaces to develop fundamental insight into energy flow and chemical reactions important in clean energy and transformative manufacturing processes. Applications are encouraged that develop AI/ML methods for the construction of potential energy surfaces and optimization of chemical kinetic mechanisms. (CLOSED)\n\n3. Gas-Particle Interconversions comprises research on the chemistry of small gas-phase particles, including their interactions with gas-phase molecules and dynamic evolution to understand the molecular mechanisms of formation, growth and transformation (such as evaporation, phase transition, and reactive processing) of small particles. (OPEN)\n\n4. Gas-Surface Chemical Physics retains a strong emphasis on molecular-scale investigations of gas-phase chemical processes with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the cooperative effects of coupling gas phase chemistry with surface chemistry. Applications are encouraged that explore the cooperative effects of gas-\n\nsurface coupling for systems relevant to clean energy or transformative manufacturing.\n\n(OPEN)\n\n5. Ultrafast Imaging/Spectroscopy includes studies of the short timescale phenomena underlying photochemical and photophysical processes, such as photodissociation, isomerization, and nonadiabatic dynamics. Applications are encouraged that develop AI/ML methods for analyzing ultrafast images/spectra or to provide insight into chemical systems associated with clean energy or transformative manufacturing. (CLOSED)\n\n\n\nResearch applications will be accepted from only a subset of the selected five research thrusts in response to each year's FOA, with the remaining thrusts offered in alternate years.

It will fund projects that support the increase of capacity of national disability organizations and their partners to address intersectional barriers that impact inclusion of persons with disabilities.\n**What this program offers**\n\n\n\nThis funding stream recognizes that the disability community is not a homogeneous group and that instead multiple communities and people experience exclusion because of a variety of barriers and many intersecting identities. Disability organizations and partners must broaden their understanding of accessibility and inclusion and create solutions to remove barriers for persons with disabilities so that they can be fully and actively engaged in society.\n\n\n\nThe funding envelope for this stream is $3 million over 2 years\n\n\n\nThe minimum funding available per agreement will be: $500,000\n\n\n\nThe maximum funding available per agreement will be: $700,000\n\n\n\nFunding is for collaborative projects for up to 24 months\n\n\n\nOrganizational project funding is available in the other stream for funding under this call for proposals.

They are necessary for the organization to manage activities outlined in the work plan and to administer the reporting requirements of the contribution agreement, including project management costs.\n\n\n\n**Capacity**\n\n\n\nThe skills, knowledge, tools, equipment, and other resources needed by organizations to do their jobs well. Examples of resources include human resources (staff, volunteers, knowledge and skills); material resources (space and equipment); and financial resources (budget, grants, and contributions, leveraged cash and in-kind contributions).\n\n\n\n-   **Organizational capacity building:** The process by which organizations obtain, and improve, capacity to support their projects effectively to advance their objectives and improve performance. This could mean building a new capacity or improving an existing capacity to allow for a larger scale, larger audience, and larger impact\n\n-   **Intersectional capacity building:** The process by which organizations obtain, and improve, capacity to address the barriers that result from intersecting processes of discrimination, oppression, power, and privilege\n\n\n\n**Cultural competency**\n\n\n\nThe ability to work or respond effectively across cultures responding to, respecting and taking into consideration the cultural specificities. Cultural competency requires a service to adapt or change to be effective.\n\n\n\n**Disability**\n\n\n\nThe Accessible Canada Act defines disability as: \"Any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment - or a functional limitation   whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person s full and equal participation in society\".\n\n\n\nThis definition is based on the social model of disability.\n\n\n\n**Disability organization**\n\n\n\nA not-for-profit organization whose primary mandate promotes or contributes to the social inclusion of persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n**Disability-related lived-experience**\n\n\n\nA lived experience can refer to familiarity with a given subject. People with a lived experience are people who:\n\n\n\n-   self-identify with a disability\n\n-   have a family member with a disability\n\n-   are providing caregiving to a person with a disability\n\n\n\nFamily members may include any family relative, whether related by marriage, common-law partnership, or any legal parent child relationship.\n\n\n\n**Distribution list**\n\n\n\nA list of contacts that receive communication.\n\n\n\n**Diverse population of persons with disabilities**\n\n\n\nThe recognition that people with disabilities are affected by multiple intersecting experiences based on gender, race, income, sexuality, and more.\n\n\n\n**Gender-based analysis plus (GBA+)**\n\n\n\nAn analytical approach used to evaluate the potential effects policies, programs and initiatives may have on diverse groups of people.\n\n\n\nThe word  Plus  in the term is used to show that the analysis goes beyond biological (sex) and sociocultural (gender) differences. It also considers other factors that intersect to determine individual identity. These factors may include race, sexual identity, age, disability, religion, etc.\n\n\n\n**Inclusion**\n\n\n\nThe practice of using proactive measures to create an environment where people feel welcomed, respected, and valued. It fosters a sense of belonging and engagement in economic, social, political, and cultural life.\n\n\n\nThis practice involves changing the environment by removing barriers so that each person has equal access to opportunities and resources. It also aids them in reaching their full potential by taking active inclusionary measures to facilitate their participation.\n\n\n\n-   **Social Inclusion:** The conditions in which individuals can participate in, contribute to, and benefit from economic, social, political, and cultural life. Social inclusion facilitates opportunities to enhance and maintain the well-being of all people. Promoting social inclusion requires tackling social exclusion by removing barriers to people s participation in society. It also means taking active inclusionary measures to facilitate such participation\n\n\n\n**Information guide**\n\n\n\nA centralized source of information created and distributed by an organization to spread knowledge, provide resources, etc.\n\n\n\n**In-kind contribution**\n\n\n\nAny contribution other than cash, like services and/or resources that are offered freely to an organization that would otherwise have a real market value and be considered an eligible cost under the SDPP-D program. These contributions could include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n-   sharing of knowledge and expertise\n\n-   use of office space\n\n-   use of equipment (for example, computers, software, etc.)\n\n-   sharing of staff (for example, staff time offered to the organization by a partner, where the organization is not charged)\n\n\n\n**Intersectionality**\n\n\n\nA term coined in 1989 by Kimberle Crenshaw, and built upon by other Black feminist scholars. It acknowledges the ways in which people s experiences are shaped by their multiple and overlapping identities and social locations. It also considers intersecting processes of discrimination, oppression, power, and privilege. Together, these interlocking identities and processes can produce a unique and distinct experience for an individual or group, such as the creation of additional barriers or opportunities.\n\n\n\n**Intersectional approaches**\n\n\n\nFor this CFP, an intersectional approach refers to the understanding of how diverse populations of persons with disabilities experience multiple barriers to social inclusion (for example, the relationship between social exclusion, racism, and disability) and the design of a solution to address these barriers.\n\n\n\nFor example, a disability organization can build partnership with a 2SLGTBQI+ organization to work on a project that will address issues specific to 2SLGBTQI+ persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n**Lead organization**\n\n\n\nThe applicant in the CFP process. The lead organization oversees and coordinates the project activities. The lead organization must ensure that the partnership-based project is successful by providing leadership, direction, and coordination to the partner organization.\n\n\n\n**Leveraging**\n\n\n\nA process through which funded organizations obtain cash or/and in-kind contributions from partners to assist in the development and implementation of their projects.\n\n\n\n**National reach**\n\n\n\nThis is determined through the ways in which current activities advance the social inclusion of persons with disabilities across three or more regions.\n\n\n\n-   **Current activities:** Current services, programming or outreach\n\n-   **Outreach:** The act of engaging with and extending services, information, support, or assistance to a specific target disability group. It involves working actively to identify specific gaps and addressing them while establishing connections to better serve a target group. Outreach work also includes actively engaging on a regular basis with similar partners or organizations to improve social outcomes for persons with disabilities\n\n-   **Regions**\n\n    -   Under the SDPP Terms and Conditions, Canadian regions are defined as:\n\n        -   Pacific (British Columbia and Yukon)\n\n        -   Prairie (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba)\n\n        -   Central (Ontario and Quebec)\n\n        -   Atlantic (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia)\n\n        -   North (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)\n\n\n\nNote: For this CFP, having a website that is accessible to people across the country does not constitute national reach or grant national status to an organization.\n\n\n\n **Nothing without us** \n\n\n\n Nothing without us  comes from the disability rights movement slogan  Nothing about us, without us . The United Nations integrated this slogan into the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We apply the principle,  Nothing without us , to the policy development process. This means including the perspectives of persons with disabilities in all initiatives, regardless if the initiative targets persons with disabilities (Source: The COVID-19 Disability Advisory Group 2020 report).\n\n\n\n**Outcome - immediate**\n\n\n\nAn outcome that is directly attributable to a policy, program, or initiative s outputs. In terms of timeframe and level, these are short-term outcomes and are often at the level of an increase in awareness of a target population.\n\n\n\n**Outcome - intermediate**\n\n\n\nAn outcome that is expected to logically occur once an immediate outcome(s) has (have) been achieved. In terms of timeframe and level, these are medium-term outcomes and are often at the change of behaviour level among a target population.\n\n\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n\n\nA collaboration or network in which an organization engages with individuals or other groups throughout a project s life cycle.\n\n\n\n**Professional development**\n\n\n\nProcess of improving knowledge, skills, and abilities to advance careers, improve current skills and employability. At the same time empowering persons with disabilities to maximize potential, develop expertise, adapt to change, and thrive in the workplace.\n\n\n\n**Project**\n\n\n\nStructured and defined goal-oriented effort to achieve specific goals and outcomes within a defined timeframe, budget, and scope. The life cycle of a project includes four phases: initiation, planning, implementation, and evaluation. A temporary project can become permanent when added to an organization s programming.\n\n\n\n-   **Initiation:** The first phase of a project s life cycle. In this phase, you review the project s goals, stakeholders, and overall feasibility to mark the beginning of the project\n\n-   **Planning:** The second phase of a project s life cycle. In this phase, you clearly define the milestones, activities/tasks, timelines, and responsibilities included in the development of a project plan\n\n-   **Implementation:** The third phase of a project s life cycle. This phase involves executing the project s planned activities and tasks. During this phase, you monitor progress, making sure that objectives are on track and changes can be made if necessary. This phase may also include reporting to better complement the evaluation phase of the project s life cycle\n\n-   **Evaluation:** An evaluation ideally happens throughout the project s life cycle (for example, after specific steps) to evaluate the performance, outcomes, and deliverables. The evaluation phase should provide insight to improve future projects. This is achieved by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well as gathering feedback and measuring performance/impact\n\n\n\n**Project partners**\n\n\n\nActive participating organization(s) that play an essential role and have a vested interest in the project s success. Partners can contribute resources to the project, either in-cash and/or in-kind (for example, time, resources, expertise).\n\n\n\n**Racialized persons**\n\n\n\nA group of people categorized according to ethnic or racial characteristics and subjected to discrimination and racism on that basis.\n\n\n\n**Sustainability plan**\n\n\n\nA plan that describes how an organization will sustain and build upon the capacity achieved through this funding for a minimum of 2 years. The sustainability plan could include activities that:\n\n\n\n-   identify and set out sustainable fundraising practices (other than government funding)\n\n-   develop knowledge transfer and retention practices to make sure that new skills are not lost to employee turnover\n\n-   ensure organizational governance by the creation of a leadership pipeline or succession plan\n\n\n\n**Systemic barrier**\n\n\n\nA barrier that results from seemingly neutral systems, practices, policies, traditions, or cultures. It also disadvantages certain individuals or groups of people. Systemic barriers are not necessarily put in place intentionally.\n\n\n\nThey disadvantage:\n\n\n\n-   minority groups\n\n-   racialized groups\n\n-   people with disabilities\n\n-   people from 2SLGBTQI+ communities\n\n-   Indigenous people and\n\n-   other marginalized people and groups\n\n\n\nSystemic barriers are present in all aspects of society such as employment, education, institutions, and health services.\n\n\n\n**Travel expenses**\n\n\n\nTravel expenditures include the following expenses:\n\n\n\n-   transportation of people by air, rail, sea, bus, taxi, air taxi and tolls\n\n-   meals, incidentals, and accommodation services such as hotels, motels, corporate residences, apartments, private non-commercial accommodation, and government and institutional accommodation\n\n\n\n**Underrepresented groups**\n\n\n\nA group of people whose representation within a given subgroup of society is lower than its representation in the general population. Under-represented groups often face systemic barriers.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a group of people represents 20% of the general population but only 10% of the workers in each field of employment, it is an under-represented group in that employment field.\n\n\n\nGroups generally considered to be under-represented include women, people with disabilities, Indigenous people, members of 2SLGBTQI+ communities and racialized groups.\n\n\n\n**2SLGBTQI+**\n\n\n\nTwo-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, and intersex. The symbol  +  represents the wide spectrum of gender identities, sexual orientations and romantic orientations not explicitly named.\n\n\n\nThe choice of letters or symbols and the order in which they are presented could differ depending on the context and the audience. Some examples of abbreviations include:\n\n\n\n-   LGBT\n\n-   LGBTI\n\n-   LGBTQ\n\n-   LGBTQ2\n\n-   LGBTQ2S\n\n-   LGBTQ2IA\n\n-   LGBTQ2IA+\n\n-   2SLGBTQIA+\n\n-   2SLGBTQQIA\n\n\n\nWhen there are 2  Q s in the abbreviation, the second  Q  stands for  questioning.\"",

        "description": "\"**What we're looking for**\n**Scope**\n\n\n\nYou can submit a collaborative research proposal in any area of the social sciences within the remit of ESRC and FNR.\n\n\n\nUK and Luxembourg applicants should ensure that their joint applications are well balanced, with clear roles and objectives attributed to both sides of the collaboration. Within the joint applications, the UK collaborator should be the lead applicant contributing with a slightly higher research effort.\n\n\n\nWe will fund basic, applied and strategic research from any disciplines and on any topics within ESRC's remit. Ambitious and novel proposals addressing new concepts and techniques are encouraged, as are those with the potential for significant scientific or societal and economic impact. There are no thematic or methodological priorities; we will fund the highest quality proposals received, regardless of focus or approach.\n\n\n\nProposals can draw from the wider sciences, as long as the social sciences are more than 50% of the focus and effort. We will work with other research councils to ensure that applications close to remit boundaries are assessed by the most appropriate lead council. For a full list of [ESRC disciplines](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/esrc/what-is-social-science/social-science-disciplines/#contents-list), or if you are unsure whether your project is suitable for ESRC funding, please [check the eligibility of your proposal](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/guidance-for-applicants/check-if-you-are-eligible-for-funding/).\n\n\n\n**Duration**\n\n\n\nThe duration of this award is up to five years (60 months).\n\n\n\n**Funding available**\n\n\n\nESRC funds the UK part of your project and FNR funds the Luxembourg part of your project. Costs to be incurred by UK and Luxembourg applicants must be clearly differentiated in the application and compatible with existing financial practices pertinent to the UKRI Councils and FNR, respectively. The budget requested from FNR needs to be justified in the proposal submitted to UKRI.\n\n\n\nCosts being requested from FNR by Luxembourg applicants should not be entered into the UKRI systems. Luxembourg applicants should complete the FNR-specific forms noted below on costs to be requested from FNR. These documents are available on [FNR s website](https://www.fnr.lu/funding-instruments/inter/).\n\n\n\nFor the UK-funded part of your proposal:\n\n\n\n-   the full economic cost of your project can range from £350,000 to £1 million\n\n-   ESRC will fund 80% of the full economic cost\n\n\n\nFor the FNR-funded part of your proposal:\n\n\n\n-   the funding you request from FNR must follow the relevant FNR funding rules\n\n\n\nYou do not have to request equal amounts from ESRC and FNR. The difference should reflect the variations in costs and local prices.\n\n\n\n**What we will fund**\n\n\n\nFor the UK-funded part of your proposal, funding can support:\n\n\n\n-   standard research projects\n\n-   methodological development\n\n-   large-scale surveys or other infrastructures. For example, linguistic corpora or the classification, cataloguing and compilation of information which would be of benefit to social science researchers and a possible wider audience\n\n\n\n**What we will not fund**\n\n\n\nFor the UK-funded part of your proposal, applications cannot be accepted under this funding opportunity solely for:\n\n\n\n-   unspecified research work\n\n-   research already carried out\n\n-   writing up previous research\n\n-   literature surveys\n\n-   general conference attendance, not related to a project\n\n-   travel for general study\n\n-   expeditions\n\n-   requests to hold conferences, workshops or seminars where these constitute the primary project component\n\n-   preparation of books and publications\n\n-   preparation and production of materials such as curriculum materials and software development where these constitute the primary project component\n\n\n\nAssociated studentships cannot be funded under this funding opportunity.\n\n\n\n**Supporting skills and talent**\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to follow the principles of the [Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers](https://researcherdevelopmentconcordat.ac.uk/) and the [Technician Commitment](https://www.techniciancommitment.org.uk/).\n\n\n\n**International collaboration**\n\n\n\nIf your application includes international applicants, project partners or collaborators, visit [UKRI s trusted research and innovation](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/policies-standards-and-data/good-research-resource-hub/trusted-research-and-innovation/) for more information on effective international collaboration.\n\n\n\nFind out about [getting funding for international collaboration](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/international-funding/getting-funding-for-international-collaboration/).\n\n\n\n**ESRC data infrastructure**\n\n\n\nESRC supports a range of data infrastructure. Where relevant, we encourage applicants to consider whether the use of these resources could add value to the project. See [facilities and resources](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/facilities-and-resources/) for information on finding and using ESRC datasets which are available across the UK.\n\n\n\nWhere relevant, details of datasets and infrastructure to be used in your project should be given in the Facilities section.\n\n\n\n**Data requirements**\n\n\n\nESRC recognises the importance of data quality and provenance. Data generated by ESRC-funded research must be well-managed by the grant holder to enable their data to be exploited to the maximum potential for further research. See our [research data policy](https://www.ukri.org/publications/esrc-research-data-policy/) for details and further information on [data requirements](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics-guidance/data-requirements/). The requirements of the research data policy are a condition of ESRC research funding.\n\n\n\nWhere relevant, details on data management and sharing should be provided in the Data Management section. See [the importance of managing and sharing data](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) and [content for inclusion in a data management plan](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/plan-to-share/esrc-data-management-plan-and-policy/) on the UK Data Service (UKDS) website for further guidance. We expect applicants to provide a summary of the points provided. The UKDS (email: [datasharing@ukdataservice.ac.uk](mailto:datasharing@ukdataservice.ac.uk)) will be pleased to advise applicants on the availability of data within the academic community and provide advice on data deposit requirements.\n\n\n\n**Impact, innovation and interdisciplinarity**\n\n\n\nWe expect applicants to consider the potential [scientific, societal and economic impacts of their research](https://www.ukri.org/publications/including-impact-in-your-research-proposal/). Outputs, dissemination and impact are a key part of the criteria for most peer review and assessment processes. We also encourage applications that demonstrate [innovation and interdisciplinarity](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/guidance-for-applicants/impact-innovation-and-interdisciplinarity-expectations/) (research combining approaches from more than one discipline).\n\n\n\n**Knowledge exchange and collaboration**\n\n\n\nWe are committed to knowledge exchange and encouraging collaboration between researchers and the private, public and civil society sectors. Collaborative working benefits both the researchers and the individuals or organisations involved. Through collaboration, partners learn about each other s expertise, share knowledge and gain an appreciation of different professional cultures. Collaborative activity can therefore lead to a better understanding of the ways that academic research can add value and offer insights to key issues of concern for policy and practice.\n\n\n\nKnowledge exchange should not be treated as an 'add-on  at the end of a project but considered before the start and built into a project.\n\n\n\n**Equitable partnership principles**\n\n\n\nWhen undertaking research and innovation activities outside the UK, you must recognise and address the possible impact of contextual, societal and cultural differences on the ethical conduct of those activities.\n\n\n\nResearchers should also follow the principles of equitable partnerships to address inherent power imbalances when working with partners in resource-poor settings.\n\n\n\nApplying the principles will encourage equitable access, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), while maintaining incentives for innovation. You should consider the principles from the start of the research and development cycle.\n\n\n\nRead [UKRI s guidance on research in a global setting](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/policies-standards-and-data/good-research-resource-hub/research-in-a-global-setting/).\n\n\n\n**Research ethics**\n\n\n\nESRC requires that the research we support is designed and conducted in such a way that it meets ethical principles and is subject to proper professional and institutional oversight in terms of research governance. We have agreed a Framework for Research Ethics that all submitted proposals must comply with. Read [further details about the Framework for Research Ethics](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/) and guidance on compliance.\"",

        "description": "\"**A.  Program Objective**\nThe National Sea Grant College Program (Sea Grant) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) support a Ph.D. graduate fellowship in two specific areas (1) population and ecosystem dynamics (PED) and (2) marine resource economics (MRE). The intent of this opportunity is to award a limited number of fellowships each year to students who are interested in careers related to population and ecosystem dynamics and marine resource economics with applications to living marine resources.\n\n\n\nCandidate projects will focus on at least one of the following: 1) the population dynamics of living marine resources; 2) stock assessment methodologies and management applications;\n\n3) marine ecosystem modeling; 4) integrated ecosystem assessments; 5) ecosystem-based management of marine ecosystems; 6) quantitative survey methodologies, and 7) economics of the conservation and management of living marine resources.\n\n\n\nThe fellowship can provide support for up to three years for highly qualified graduate students working towards a Ph.D. in quantitative ecology, ecosystem ecology, population dynamics or related fields of study such as wildlife biology, fishery biology, natural resource management, marine biology, quantitative ecology, applied mathematics, applied statistics, simulation modeling, marine resource economics, natural resource economics, or environmental economics.\n\n\n\nEach fellow will be required to work closely with an expert (mentor) from NMFS who may provide data for the fellow's thesis, serve on the fellow's committee, and/or host an annual summer internship at the participating NMFS facility. Mentors will be from participating NMFS Science Centers or offices.\n\n\n\n**B.  Program Priorities**\n\n\n\nSea Grant is seeking applications for its fellowship programs to fulfill its broad educational responsibilities, enhance workforce development, and to strengthen the collaboration between Sea Grant and the NMFS. Fellows will work on thesis problems of public interest and relevance to NMFS and work with NMFS mentors at participating NMFS Science Centers or offices. The program priorities for this opportunity support NOAA's healthy oceans goal of \"marine fisheries, habitats, biodiversity sustained with healthy and productive ecosystems.\"\n\nNotice of Federal Funding Page 4 of 20\n\n\n\nThe goals of the program are to 1) encourage qualified applicants to pursue careers in population and ecosystem dynamics related to living marine resources; 2) encourage qualified applicants to pursue careers in marine resource economics; 3) increase available expertise related to quantitative ecology for systems of living marine resources; 4) increase available expertise related to the economic analysis of living marine resource conservation and management decisions; 5) foster closer relationships between academic scientists and NMFS; and 6) provide real-world experience to graduate students and accelerate their career development.\n\n\n\nFor those applicants with population and ecosystem dynamics topics: The fellowship covers both population and ecosystem dynamics to ensure support for fellows who conduct research in support of assessments of living marine resource stocks as well as conduct broadly-scoped ecosystem assessments, implement ecosystem-based management, and evaluate system-level considerations of living marine resources. As both ecosystem and population dynamics rely heavily on quantitative marine ecology methods and skills, this announcement reflects that underlying commonality.\n\n\n\n**C.  Program Authority**\n\n\n\nStatutory authority for this program is provided under the National Sea Grant College Program Act of 1966, as amended (33 USC 1121 et seq.).\"",

        "description": "\"This Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) replaces NSF 20-085: DCL: Pilot Projects to Integrate Existing Data and Data-Focused Cyberinfrastructure to Enable Community-level Discovery Pathways.\nMany research communities supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) are challenged by the need to manage, integrate, access, and use ever larger and diverse scientific datasets to conduct research. NSF accordingly invests in the creation of a wide range of data-focused cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools, resources, and solutions for use by the various disciplinary communities that it supports in order to transform data into knowledge and discovery.\n\n\n\nScientific endeavors are increasingly collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and convergent. NSF thus recognizes the importance of promoting holistic CI approaches to address the growing and evolving data lifecycle and workflow challenges both within and across research fields. This holistic view is articulated in NSF's recent vision1 for an agile CI ecosystem, and is predicated on harmonization, integration and interoperability among CI resources, tools, services and expertise to achieve accessible, seamless and flexible end-to-end discovery pathways that drive new thinking and enable transformative discoveries.\n\n\n\nThrough this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), NSF encourages proposals to the Cyberinfrastructure for Emerging Science and Engineering Research (CESER) program2 within the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for pilot projects that bring together researchers and CI experts to develop the means of combining existing community data resources and shared data-focused CI into new integrative and highly performing data-intensive discovery workflows that empower new scientific pathways. Aims of such pilot projects can include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n- improving the end-to-end process of accessing, integrating and transforming research and education data to knowledge and discovery for one or more communities;\n\n- creating new workflows and new usage modes to address multi-disciplinary and cross-domain scientific objectives;\n\n- addressing emerging community-scale scientific data challenges such as real-time, streaming and on-demand data access; data discovery through knowledge networks and intelligent data delivery; enabling access to data with privacy  concerns; and data fusion, integration and interoperability;\n\n- enhancing the performance and robustness of community-scale data integration and discovery workflows such as through automated curation, end-to-end performance monitoring, provenance tracking, and means of assuring data trustworthiness; and\n\n- federating learner data to empower innovative assessment tools for large-scale modeling of learning gains.\n\n\n\nThe following NSF directorates emphasize interest in specific topical areas for proposals:\n\n\n\nDirectorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE): Proposals are encouraged on enabling accessibility, integration, discovery, management and analysis of community-scale research data in support of identified science objectives or use cases, such as those related to wireless networking, cybersecurity, machine learning applications, and related performance monitoring and assessment. CISE particularly welcomes proposals that aim to enable community-scale integration of, and access to, data sets from individual investigators and/or those generated by industry to enable new research and discovery broadly for the CISE and other research communities.\"",

        "description": "\"The JackThroughout Europe, dispossession was an integral component of the mass murder of Jews and Roma during the Holocaust. Interviews with survivors, eyewitnesses, and collaborators in Eastern Europe affirm that theft was a common reason for the active participation of local populations in the mass killings known as the \"Holocaust by bullets.\" The personal belongings of victims ended up in the families and homes of those who conducted the killings or assisted the perpetrators. Others were redistributed to local populations or sold at auctions; locals moved into houses previously owned by their Jewish neighbors.\n\n\n\nDespite efforts at property restitution following the 2009 Terezin Declaration on Holocaust Era Assets and Related Issues, both academic study and public awareness of the scope of the looting by local populations and the massive losses of Jewish and Romani immovable property in the Holocaust remains scant. Furthermore, it also remains unclear how attempts at property restitution are perceived by their intended recipients-the descendants of the victims. \n\n\n\nThis workshop focuses on historical justice through the lens of things and property. Ethnographic research with families of Holocaust survivors and victims indicates that they understand justice in terms of *moral materialities* that is, restitution is, for them, inextricable from recognition, the restoration of personal dignity, and inclusion into society. Their experiences lead us to ask: How do possessions and property feature in claims about identity and social belonging made by the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors and victims? How do stories of theft and appropriation raise public awareness of the material annihilation of Jewish and Romani communities? What sorts of social dynamics and historical relationships are prompted by the discovery of Jewish and Romani things and property in non-Jewish/non-Romani homes? How do  understanding of historical justice articulated in stories about possessions and property in local Jewish and Romani communities differ from conceptualizations of historical justice in national and transnational projects that focus on restitution of Jewish property?\n\n\n\nAddressing these questions in our workshop, our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to historical justice that accounts for the fate of possessions and property and their biographies of new  ownership,  and foregrounds articulations of  history and justice by Jewish and Romani communities in terms of moral materialities in the context of national and international perspectives on historical justice. To do so, we will consider these topics from several interrelated angles: 1) object biographies of the things and property looted during the Holocaust, including items in museum collections, 2) individual experiences in reclaiming possessions and property after the war, processes and practices related to large-scale restitution programs, and theorizations of justice through restitution, 3) public cognizance, recollection, remembrance, and/or denial of local involvement in the appropriation of possessions and property through theft, looting, redistribution, or (re)sale during the Holocaust, and 4) the stories of theft and appropriation passed down in the family realm or shared within Jewish and Romani communities. \n\n\n\nIn addition to shedding light on the processes related to historical justice after the Holocaust, we hope to contribute to discussions about Holocaust restitution in various public spheres and expand conceptualizations of transnational and state-level justice to include the perspectives of their intended beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nDaily sessions of the workshop will consist of presentations and roundtable discussions led by participants, as well as discussions with Museum staff and research in the Museum's collections. The workshop will be conducted in English.\"",

Pila Nguru people left their ancestral homelands when the British began nuclear testing in the Australian desert. They began painting in 1997 as part of their Native Title claim involving the return of their homelands. Kluge-Ruhe's collection contains works by such leading artists as Lawrence Pennington, Tjaruwa Woods and Patju Presley.\n\n\n\nThis fellowship is divided into two residential periods totalling six months with a holiday break in December-January. Research and development will take place over four months between mid-August and mid-December 2024. The fellow will return to Charlottesville for two months in February and March 2025 to oversee installation and implement programs associated with the exhibition.\n\n\n\nThis schedule aligns with the semesters at the University of Virginia, ensuring that the fellow has access to museum curators, staff, and academic partners throughout the residency. It also allows production time for didactics and the printed catalogue prior to the exhibition opening. The precise timing of the fellowship will be negotiated with the successful applicant and some flexibility is possible.\n\n\n\nThe residency will coincide with activities at Kluge-Ruhe including an artist residency (August 2024) and the opening of the major touring exhibition *Madayin: Eight Decades of Aboriginal Australian Bark Painting from Yirrkala* at the Asia Society in New York (September 2024). Each of these programs will provide opportunities for the fellow to engage with Indigenous Australian artists visiting the USA.\"",

In 1962, he took a job as a clerk at The Philadelphia Inquirer, and six years later became a reporter assigned to cover the police beat. He worked his way through the ranks, ultimately becoming a columnist, a member and associate editor of the Editorial Board, and the newspaper's Associate Editor Emeritus, a title he held until his death.  \n\n  \n\nAlong the way, Acel won a Pulitzer Prize with colleague Wendell L. Rawls Jr. for an investigation of harsh conditions at the Fairview (Penn.) State Hospital. Their stories exposed the brutal treatment of mentally disturbed prisoners and led to reforms.  \n\n  \n\nAcel is most remembered for his ability to connect to everyday people and his love for telling their stories, which had been largely ignored by the mainstream press. Through them, he captured the universality of the human experience.  \n\n  \n\n\"Year after year, in column after column, Moore introduced the people of Philadelphia to each other, knowing that most of them, because of race and class and calcified ignorance, would never have met any other way,\" wrote colleague and friend Butch Ward of the Poynter Institute, when Acel died in February 2016.  \n\n  \n\n Moore believed they needed to meet.

The grant contributes to costs incurred by clinical and non-clinical neurologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and others for overseas visits or attendance at scientific meetings.\n\n\n\nTravel Grants are restricted to those in doctoral training (ie. PhD students, or UK based 3-year research MD) and post doctoral training (whether clinically qualified or not) and for work undertaken while based in the United Kingdom. A maximum of three separate awards may be available to each applicant, with not more than one award in any 12 month period. \n\n\n\nThe awards are not intended to support student electives, undergraduate projects or MSc students. Support will not normally be given where the applicant is supported by a Fellowship or grant funding that already provides travel costs. The awards are not intended to support taught training courses or teaching-based summer schools. We prioritise candidates at an early stage of their career, and so if you are 10 or more years from your PhD, please ensure that the letter of support explains your special case or exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n\nIf a travel grant is awarded then a single payment is made. **The outcome of applications is typically notified by email, ~4 weeks ahead of travel**. A hard copy confirmation of the award and cheque is then sent by post. ***It is your responsibility to ensure that the UK address you provide is correct and sufficiently detailed to receive a cheque. Please note we do not send post abroad.***\n\n\n\nWe provide up to up to £400 for UK meetings, up to £600 for European meetings outside of the UK, and up to £1000 for meetings further afield, depending on the destination. As part of the assessment, we also expect partial funding from your institution or for example a travel award from the conference. Application must be initiated on this website **at least 9 weeks before the planned meeting** and fully submitted **at least 8 weeks before the meeting date**. Do not attempt to subvert these rules by misrepresentation of the dates of travel or the dates of a meeting.\"",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of the following Expected Outcomes:  \n\n\n\n- Healthcare providers increase their knowledge on the potential of combined ATMPs and get access to innovative treatment options with demonstrated health benefits for unmet medical needs;  \n\n- Developers and manufacturers of combined ATMPs obtain scientific evidence on the proposed therapeutic approach;  \n\n- Patients benefit from new advanced therapies delivered through the combined ATMPs;  \n\n- EU companies get a better market position in the field of combined ATMPs. Scope:  \n\nThe subjects of this topic are combined ATMPs (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) according to the definition of the ATMP-regulation (EU 1394/2007, Article 2d). Such combined ATMPs are composed of an ATMP and one or more medical devices or one or more active implantable medical devices, and their cellular or tissue part must either contain viable cells or tissues, or non-viable cells or tissues liable for exerting the primary action on the human body.  \n\n\n\nThe combined ATMPs should be more effective than current state-of-the-art solutions on the European market owing to improved features like personalisation, accuracy, reliability and usability and contribute to long-term sustainability (faster and affordable) of European health systems.  \n\n\n\nResearch should focus on advanced stages of clinical development with regulatory work on the Medical Device part completed and safety studies of the combination product in an advanced stage.  \n\n\n\nProposals should address all of the following activities:  \n\n\n\n- Phase 2 clinical trials and above of combined ATMPs focussing on:   \n\n- technologies ready to undergo interventional clinical trials in patients/end users assessing the usability and clinical performance, and/or  \n\n- technologies that have demonstrable safety/performance profiles and should undergo clinical validation in view of their inclusion into guidelines for specific clinical pathways.   \n\n- Delivery of safe and clinically validated combined ATMPs that are compliant with current European regulatory requirements. The related regulatory work should be considered as an essential component and the proposed work should involve consultation/interaction with competent regulatory agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or national regulatory agency. Applicants are encouraged to seek regulatory and/or Health Technology Assessment (HTA) advice as appropriate.   \n\nThe topic invites proposals that include innovative treatments for any medical condition excluding rare diseases that are ready to be assessed for clinical efficacy (performance and clinical benefit) in a specific indication on a big number of patient cohorts; already existing market solutions are not in the scope of this topic.  \n\n\n\nSex and gender aspects, age, socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors and any other non-health related individual attributes should be taken into consideration. SME participation is strongly encouraged.  \n\n\n\nApplicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See definition of clinical studies in the introduction to this work programme part.\"",

Applicants should thoughtfully consider their reason for deciding to apply to conduct a program to serve the proposed population, including the particular age group of children and, if applicable, pregnant women. This decision should be based on the needs of the community. This NOFO provides applicants the opportunity to propose to reallocate funding between Head Start and EHS based on both the needs in the community and the applicant's capacity and experience serving pregnant women, infants, toddlers, and/or preschool-age children. Applicants may explore combining Head Start and EHS funds with resources from\n\nother early childhood programs or funding streams, including state, local, and private sector funding for child care, pre-kindergarten, and special education services. Please note that applicants responding to this NOFO will be expected to begin providing Head Start and/or EHS services quickly after award, with a minimal start-up period, to support limited to no disruption in services to the currently enrolled children and families in this service area.\"",

        "title": "\"New Investigator Gateway Awards for Collaborative T1D Research (R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-DK-21-030  \n**Background**\n\n\n\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The loss of proper glucose control that ensues leads to a variety of pathologic consequences, including complications affecting the heart, eye, nerves, kidney and urogenital systems. While the incidence of T1D is increasing worldwide, research continues into the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease onset and severity, and into the development of therapies to effectively prevent or intervene in the disease process.\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Award in T1D Research is designed to ensure a robust pipeline of innovative research and talented new investigators in T1D research. In addition to providing support for preliminary research, the Gateway program provides an opportunity for new investigators to pursue their studies within the intellectual environment of a select number of large, ongoing collaborative research programs. Embedding awardees within the established scientific framework afforded by each of these consortia will provide unique opportunities for New Investigators (NI) and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) to increase their understanding of key questions in the field, and for networks to benefit from new ideas and diverse perspectives.\n\n\n\n**Objectives and Scope**\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Award in T1D research supports New Investigators and Early Stage Investigators who are interested in pursuing careers in T1D, including qualified researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds. The goal of the program is to provide support for high quality innovative and significant research by junior faculty engaged in basic, translational and clinical research that will firmly establish the awardees in a T1D-oriented career path and set the stage for competitive first R01 submissions.\n\n\n\nA second key feature of the Gateway program is the opportunity it provides for awardees to enhance their careers through networking with investigators currently engaged in specific T1D-oriented research networks, trials and consortia. Given this feature, research to be supported should address significant barriers in T1D research that fit conceptually within the scope and goals of one of the consortia listed below.\n\n\n\nTo assist applicants in developing their application for this NIDDK initiative, there will be an information webinar hosted by NIDDK staff on March 1, 2022 from 4:00PM to 5:00PM ET. After the webinars, a list of frequently asked questions will be published. Please visit the [NIDDK Meetings and Events webpage](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/news/meetings-workshops) for more information about the Webinar and to view the FAQ after the webinar.\n\n\n\n**The Human Islet Research Network (HIRN):** The Human Islet Research Network (HIRN; [www.hirnetwork.org](http://www.hirnetwork.org/)) supports collaborative research into the loss of functional beta cell mass in type 1 diabetes (T1D). HIRN's overall mission is to better understand how human beta cells are lost in T1D, and to find innovative strategies to protect or replace functional beta cell mass in people with T1D. The HIRN program is configured as a modular network of research consortia, each defined by a specific set of research priorities.\n\n\n\nThe five current HIRN consortia include:\n\n\n\n(1) The Consortium on Beta Cell Death and Survival ([HIRN-CBDS](https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/cbds)) that is using human tissues to discover highly specific biomarkers of beta cell injury in asymptomatic T1D and developing strategies to stop beta cell destruction early in the disease process;\n\n\n\n(2) The Consortium on Human Islet Biomimetics ([HIRN-CHIB](https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/chib)) that is combining advances in beta cell and stem cell biology with tissue engineering technologies to develop microdevices that support functional human islets and immune cells;\n\n\n\n(3) The Consortium on Modeling Autoimmune Interactions ([HIRN-CMAI](https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/cmai)) that is developing innovative approaches to model basic aspects of human T1D immunobiology and pathobiology in vivo, and developing strategies to interrupt immune activation in T1D;\n\n\n\n(4) The Consortium on Targeting and Regeneration ([HIRN-CTAR](https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/ctar)) that is focused on developing methods to increase or maintain functional beta cell mass in T1D through targeted manipulation of islet plasticity, or through engineering protection of islet beta cells from immune-mediated destruction; and\n\n\n\n(5) The Human Pancreas Analysis Consortium ([HIRN-HPAC](https://hirnetwork.org/consortium/hpap)) that is investigating the physical and functional organization of the human islet tissue environment, the cell-cell relationships within the pancreatic tissue ecosystem, and the contributions of non-endocrine components (acinar, ductal, vascular, perivascular, neuronal, lymphatic, immune) to islet cell function and dysfunction.\n\n\n\n*Research opportunities that could be pursued in collaboration with HIRN consortia include, but are not limited to:*\n\n\n\n-  Using human islets and pancreatic tissues to identify components of the beta cell and its environment required for maintenance and function and/or instrumental in its pathogenic destruction;\n\n-  Identifying therapeutic targets of early disease to prevent the development of a fully developed autoimmune response, or to protect and replenish residual beta cell mass in at-risk or recently-diagnosed individuals;\n\n-  Using humanized in vivo models for exploration of the T1D pathogenesis and/or to test potential therapies;\n\n-  Developing new miniaturized assays for metabolism that could be adapted for use in biomimetic systems;\n\n-  Developing a biomimetic system that will allow for the exploration of immune beta cell interactions;\n\n-  Developing cell-based therapies to enhance or restore glycemic control;\n\n-  Identifying novel biomarkers of T1D or developing synthetic reporter systems to monitor disease initiation, progression and response to therapy; and\n\n-  Developing methods for the non-invasive measurement of beta cell mass or function that may be used as endpoints in studies of preventing or ameliorating T1D.\n\n\n\n**Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet:** Using knowledge gained through clinical research, TrialNet's mission is to prevent T1D and stop disease progression by preserving insulin production before and after diagnosis (see [https://trialnet.org](https://trialnet.org)). TrialNet performs multicenter clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies, and longitudinal studies of the natural history of disease and mechanisms of T1D pathogenesis. TrialNet is an international collaborative effort involving clinical investigators, immunologists, islet cell biologists, industry and foundation partners, and families of people with diabetes working together to bring disease-modifying therapies into clinical practice.\n\n\n\n*Research opportunities that could be pursued in collaboration with TrialNet include, but are not limited to, topics outlined in the* [*TrialNet Prioritization for Mechanistic Studies*](https://www.trialnet.org/sites/default/files/TN%20Prioritization%20of%20Mechanistic%20Studies.pdf) *such as:*\n\n\n\n-  Studies of well-characterized biomarkers that have the potential to inform the outcomes of clinical trials, such as surrogate endpoints;\n\n-  Defining biomarkers that identify different patient subpopulations based upon mechanism of disease progression, facilitating clinical trial design;\n\n-  Research into immune or metabolic pathways that provide insights into pathogenesis and/or therapeutic mechanism of action;\n\n-  Biomarker studies that will validate biomarkers against TrialNet clinical endpoints;\n\n-  Development of novel assays to measure key features of disease progression or response to therapy; and,\n\n-  Research related to the performance of more effective and efficient clinical trials for the prevention of T1D, such as strategies for participant engagement, recruiting, and retention.\n\n\n\n**The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study:** The long-term goal of the TEDDY study is to identify infectious agents, dietary factors, or other environmental agents, including psychosocial factors, that trigger T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals or that protect against the disease. Identification of such factors will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and may result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. TEDDY currently consists of a consortium of six [Clinical Centers](https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/centers/index.htm) (CC) and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) that is carrying out studies to identify environmental causes of T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals. \n\n\n\nThe TEDDY study investigates: (1) genetic and genetic-environmental interactions, including gestational infection or other gestational events; and (2) childhood infections or other environmental factors after birth, in relation to the development of prediabetic autoimmunity and Type I Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The CCs recruit and enroll subjects, including obtaining informed consent from parents prior to or shortly after birth, obtain genetic and other samples from neonates and parents, and prospectively follow selected neonates throughout childhood or until development of islet autoimmunity or T1DM. With this approach, the TEDDY Consortium provides a coordinated, multi-disciplinary approach to this complex disease. It is anticipated that collection of information and samples in the standardized manner used by TEDDY may provide greater statistical power in research studies than might be possible in smaller independent investigations. The TEDDY has initiated a nested case-control study that includes samples from children who have developed autoantibodies or have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and their age matched controls' samples, that are analyzed in TEDDY laboratories. Analyses being conducted on the samples include assays of the gut microbiome, gene expression, proteomics, metabolomics, dietary biomarkers, SNPs, and whole genome sequencing. Data from these assays are available from the NIDDK Central Repository as well as the TEDDY study website. Please see [https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/research/](https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/research/).\n\n\n\n*Research opportunities for data analysis that could be pursued in collaboration with the TEDDY study include, but are not limited to:*\n\n\n\n-  Identifying environmental agents\n\n-  Identifying biomarkers of disease\n\n-  Identifying infectious agents\n\n-  Defining etiology and pathogenesis of disease\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "title": "\"Behavioural Change And Governance For Systemic Transformations Towards Climate Resilience\"",
        "description": "\"ExpectedOutcome:  \nProjects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:  \n\n\n\n\\- Support to the implementation of the EU Adaptation Strategy and the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change.  \n\n\\- Decision-makers at local, regional, national and European level are able to more effectively scale up and accelerate behavioural change for systemic transformations towards climate resilience, knowing more about relevant social tipping points, leverage points and key governance interventions in this context.  \n\n\\- Citizens and civil society have a better understanding of possible individual actions they may wish to undertake or how to contribute to strategic leverage points that bring about behavioural change supporting climate resilience at larger scale. This should also include knowledge or development of possible governance structures and organisational innovations that would help to galvanise the already existing knowledge and activities in many parts of society.   \n\n\\- Easier assessment of the potential of and progress in scaling up change in behaviour and creating multiple positive synergies of individual and organisational actions for directing governance to achieving systemic transformations towards climate resilience. Scope:  \n\nNo matter how successful our efforts to mitigate further climate change will be, some impacts are or will be unavoidable in the future and we will have to adapt to a warmer world. The question is on what terms this adaptation will take place. With the new Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change and the recently launched Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change on this issue, Europe has set out that the direction of this change will be systemic transformations towards climate neutrality and resilience, by 2050.  \n\n\n\nAs nations, regions, cities and local communities are now developing their vision and pathways towards climate neutrality and resilience, increased importance is given to the role of behavioural change, and governance and organisational innovation in achieving the systemic transformations needed to regain resilience in a harsher climate future to events and hazards potentially attributable to climate change.  \n\n\n\nThe objectives of this topic are to reach a better understanding on behavioural change and on how it could be scaled up and connected to the governance of the various drivers of and/or barriers to climate-friendly/climate-resilient behaviour (including EU, national and local policies) to reach the goal of climate neutrality and resilience by 2050.  \n\n\n\nThe role of individual or community behavioural change in this societal transformation is to be approached as embedded in changes of informational, political, economic and technological systems. Shifts from individual values and community behaviour need to be seen as integrated with societal changes in governance, implying a combination of cultural changes and shifting social norms, alongside interventions by institutions and through the market, communications and media[1].  \n\n\n\nWithin this scope, projects are requested to enhance the understanding of:  \n\n\n\n\\- Social tipping points and leverage points in climate adaptation: to better understand the social acceptability of non-adaptive behaviours or how new adaptive behaviour would become widespread (social tipping points); to better understand how a small shift in one part of a system would generate changes across the system as a whole (leverage points); to better understand how various systems' leverage points may eventually lead to deliberate transformative tipping points; to understand how increasingly serious threats or consequences of climate change lead to changes of individual and social perceptions and behaviours, and how it leads to changes in local adaptation policies, new social organisation forms and actions. This should also include analysis of incentives and barriers to behavioural change in different spheres of the population (according to gender, social conditions, educational level, etc.).  \n\n\\- Features of good governance for systemic transformations to climate resilience: to better understand features and structures of governance and institutions to ensure economically, socially and environmentally just transformations appropriate for the local conditions, e.g. mechanisms leading to most cost-effective solutions; a fair distribution of costs and benefits of the transformations; to better understand features and structures of governance and institutions that generate a high systemic adaptive capacity, e.g. the ability to effectively leverage public-private sector investment for adaptation actions; further operationalisation of the notion of equity and justice to support the required transformative systemic adaptations in governance and policy arrangements.  \n\n\\- Transformative conditions, capacities and learning feedbacks needed for systemic change: to better understand the conditions and capacities that would allow individual behaviour to fundamentally change the system in which they operate so that the system further accelerate new learning feedbacks and changes in individual behaviour, e.g. via experimentation and requiring further access to relevant knowledge and information or opportunities to engage in transformative decision-making.   \n\nProjects should focus on all relevant aspects of society, in their interactions with biophysical and climate adaptation components, including, but not limited to, relevant economic sectors, education and up-skilling and re-skilling. Moreover, participatory co-creation approaches at policy making, community, and individual levels, including direct involvement of citizens, new sustainability-oriented business organisations and societal actors where relevant considering social innovation, is highly recommended in order to create robust results. Projects should investigate the dimension of lifestyles and habits and associated factors, motivators and barriers, and be aware of the role of gender and diversity among populations and groups of populations, and how various resources and power relations can influence people's decisions and willingness to change behaviour.  \n\n\n\nProjects are expected to contribute to and establish close coordination with the activities of the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change. They are strongly encouraged to use the results of the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change and the Copernicus Climate Change Service as testbed to underpin their findings.  \n\n\n\nFinally, projects are requested to develop the following outputs:  \n\n\n\n\\- Concrete recommendations of operational nature to accelerate systemic change in those regions and communities that served as their case studies.  \n\n\\- General guidance for all other actors at national, regional, or communal level about the most feasible and effective leverage point potentially leading to transformative tipping points, including aspects concerning interrelations, alignment and coordination of the actors/stakeholders.  \n\n\\- A science for policy operational framework and indicators for assessing the potential of and progress in scaling up change in behaviour and for directing governance to achieving systemic transformations towards climate resilience.   \n\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.  \n\n\n\n[1] Changing our ways?

The goal of this work is to continue supporting the projects under the Nuisance Wildlife Section of the Wildlife Program on JBER . See full Funding Opportunity Description in Section I.\n\n\n\nBackground Wildlife is protected under a number of statutes, such as the ESA, MBTA, State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) laws, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, etc.\n\nJBER is located within the Municipality of Anchorage in Southcentral Alaska, with abundant wildlife. Most species indigenous to southcentral Alaska can be found on JBER, including\n\n\n\nmoose, wolves, and both black and brown bears. Extensive natural areas in and around JBER provide habitat for these and other species. Conflicts routinely arise with animals that occasionally pose a health or safety hazard to Base residents, training military, and recreationists. Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan (INRMP) Goal 1 is to minimize conflicts between the military mission, wildlife, natural resources, and land use.\n\nCurrently, the JBER Conservation Law Enforcement Officers (CLEOs) respond to most wildlife nuisance calls and conflict situations on JBER, particularly involving potentially dangerous animals such as moose and bears. The CLEOs have responded to an average (five-year average, 2020-2016) of 474 wildlife calls.\n\n\n\nIn 1996, the State of Alaska recognized the unique nature of human-wildlife conflicts within the greater Anchorage area (including JBER lands) and began a planning program designed to mitigate human-wildlife interactions.  The program publishes a guide entitled \"Living with Wildlife\" and JBER staff are participants in the planning group responsible for the document and its revision(s).  In 2000, JBER became a signatory to the 2000 MOU Regarding a Comprehensive Wildlife Management Plan, Living with Wildlife in Anchorage: A Cooperative Planning Effort for Anchorage, Alaska (FWS70181-9-K235). Other key signatories included ADF&G, the Municipality of Anchorage, USFWS, and other land and natural resource management agencies. Two (2) of the stated goals of this program are to  Minimize opportunities for conflicts between wildlife and people  and  Foster a sense of stewardship for wildlife and their habitats among the public, non-governmental organizations, and local governmental agencies.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-23-254  \n**Purpose**  \n\n\n\nThrough this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with other participating Institutes encourages submission of applications proposing to conduct secondary data analysis and integration of existing datasets and database resources, with the ultimate aim to elucidate cancer risk and related outcomes (e.g., risk prediction or reduction, survival, or response to treatment, etc.). The goal of this initiative is to address key scientific questions relevant to cancer by supporting the analysis of existing clinical, environmental, surveillance, health services, vital statistics, behavioral, lifestyle, genomic, and molecular profiles data. Applicants are encouraged to leverage and perform innovative analyses of the existing data. Applications may include new research aims that are being addressed with existing data, new or advanced methods of analyses, or novel combinations and integration of datasets that allow the exploration of important scientific questions in cancer research.\n\n\n\nThis NOFO runs in parallel with another NOFO of identical scientific scope, [PAR-23-255](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-23-255.html), which utilizes the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) mechanism.\n\n\n\n**Background and Rationale**  \n\n\n\nNIH and other research funding organizations support numerous studies that generate a large amount of phenotypical, exposure, behavioral, clinical and genomic data, which continue to be made available to the scientific community. Many of these datasets have not been analyzed to their full potential and further investigation will provide opportunities to answer important research questions at a relatively low cost.\n\n\n\nSeveral NCI programs support population science research that spans the cancer control continuum, e.g., in genomic, epidemiology, surveillance, health services, behavioral science, and cancer survivorship to understand and clarify cancer risk, progression, and outcomes. These studies generate a wealth of individual- and population-level data, including molecular, lifestyle, clinical, demographic, and environmental data. Leveraging these various types of existing data through innovative data modeling and analysis allows new questions to be addressed and helps to advance the field of cancer research. NIH has made it a priority to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) to researchers to further biomedical research, through several [sharing policies](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm), including the [2015 Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/policies/) and the [2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html). Enhanced data sharing is also a key priority of the NCI, as highlighted by the [NCI Cancer Moonshot Public Access and Data Sharing Policy](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/funding/public-access-policy) and by the [National Cancer Plan](https://nationalcancerplan.cancer.gov/goals) goal to maximize data utility by sharing and using available data to achieve rapid progress against cancer. NIH requirements for data sharing in grant proposals, combined with public and private sector initiatives by donors, journals, and foundations, have led to unprecedented amounts of available data for secondary research, which have been successfully utilized to discover novel biomarkers of disease and to find novel uses for existing therapeutics.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to encourage applications from institutions/organizations that propose to conduct innovative secondary data analyses to address knowledge gaps in cancer control using innovative approaches and integration of existing datasets with the ultimate aim of further elucidating cancer risk and related outcomes. The initiative will stimulate innovative methods and leveraging of existing data sources whose number is expected to continue increasing as more data becomes available through data sharing. \n\n\n\n**Specific Research Objectives and Scope of the NOFO**   \n\n\n\nAnalyses that incorporate the vast amount of genomic, clinical, environmental, surveillance, health services, vital statistics, behavioral, and other types of data obtained in recent years, have great potential to illuminate the complex interactions among the environment, behavior, genes, and gene products, to redefine cancer across the continuum, and to lead to novel hypotheses regarding prevention and treatment of cancer.\n\n\n\nApplicants are encouraged to leverage existing data and perform innovative analyses of the existing data. Applications may include new aims that are being addressed with existing data, new or advanced methods of analyses, or novel combinations and integration of datasets that allow the exploration of important scientific questions.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, this NOFO encourages applications that leverage existing data and could include one or more of (but not limited to) the following aspects:\n\n\n\n-  Link together and analyze through system epidemiology approaches longitudinal multi-level/domain data types, including genomic, other omics, biomarker, environmental, socio-demographic, behavioral, economic, clinical, health care delivery, disease, screening, and vital statistics (e.g., mortality) data to study specific cancer types and/or across cancers and related conditions; data can be obtained from registry, case-control, cohort, and clinical studies and should be appropriately combined and harmonized; linking could be performed by matching entities (e.g., people, direct links of the same respondents) or through external variables (e.g., geocodes, different geographic levels) to assess for multi-level influences (e.g., census tract, county, or state).\n\n-  Facilitate utilization of newly developed or updated resources, tools, and guidelines in population-scale cancer research (e.g., human genome reference or other molecular annotations, Informatics tools, or population descriptors guidelines).\n\n-  Employ innovative analytic techniques that demonstrate or promote methodological advances in genomic and epidemiologic cancer research and that accelerate population-scale genomics research, e.g., through integration of multiple data types derived from humans and obtained through various single cell and/or bulk tissue molecular techniques (germline and/or somatic genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to better understand complex interactions among genes and gene products in the context of cancer.\n\n-  Assess cancer-related behavioral health questions and risk factors (e.g., physical performance, anthropometric testing, dietary intake, exercise, physical and social environment, cancer screening, tobacco or alcohol use, sleep hygiene, etc.) through innovative methods, tools, or technology.\n\n-  Advance image analysis and extraction of behavioral and environmental information (e.g., street-level digital images, aerial images, medical images, etc.) and accelerate or automate geospatial data cleaning, processing, and analysis to address cancer related questions.\n\n-  Develop analytical strategies for cancer surveillance.\n\n-  Advance research in healthcare delivery to better understand factors that affect methods of cancer detection (screen versus symptom) and/or inequitable use of primary and secondary prevention strategies.\n\n-  Serve cancer survivors and their communities by predicting and assessing patients' diagnosis, trajectory, comorbidities, response to treatment, and symptom management.\n\n-  Address questions related to health inequities and disparities and augment implementation and translation of research findings into practice by generating or improving related methods, tools, or technology (e.g., for medical image processing in low resource settings to improve precision risk management, or for reducing machine learning biases from inaccurate data representation of the diversity of society).\n\n\n\nThis NOFO capitalizes on NCI and NIH past investments in several programs that have supported from basic biological to clinical biomedical research by leveraging the generated molecular, lifestyle, clinical, and environmental data to conduct new investigations in cancer control and population sciences, including cancer healthcare delivery, surveillance, behavior, epidemiology, and population-scale 'omics research. All data analyses must concern research designed to elucidate cancer etiology, incidence, prevalence, natural history, pathophysiology, or related outcomes, including cancer related conditions and disorders.\n\n\n\n**NCI focus**. Applicants should consider the relevance of their proposed analyses to those [NCI programs and priorities](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/annual-plan) that can be tackled through the study of existing data. Potential applicants are encouraged to speak with the listed NCI program officials to discuss the relevance of the proposed research topic(s).\n\n\n\n**NIA focus.** NIA welcomes applications that analyze and/or integrate genetic, 'omics, behavioral, social, and other datasets for the contribution of aging as a risk factor for the pathogenesis of adult cancers.&nbsnbsp; Potential applicants are encouraged to communicate with the NIA program officials to discuss their research interests and their relevance to this NOFO.\n\n\n\n**NIDCR focus.** NIDCR supports secondary data analysis and data integration research in the assessment of cancer risk, progression, and outcomes that are relevant to oral, oropharyngeal, and salivary gland cancers. NIDCR will also consider applications that incorporate new statistical or computational methods to help improve the accessibility and/or speed of dissemination of data resources. Potential applicants are encouraged to speak with the listed NIDCR program officials to discuss the relevance of the proposed research topic(s).\n\n\n\n**NHGRI focus.** NHGRI welcomes applications that develop new approaches for elucidating the genetic architecture of human health and disease which are broadly generalizable across diseases, phenotypes, and health outcomes (e.g., risk prediction or reduction, survival, or response to treatment) in addition to cancer. NHGRI is particularly interested in applications to develop novel methods for integrating multiple types of genomic data and other data types. Projects that focus only on tumor genomics will not be appropriate for NHGRI funding. NHGRI encourages leveraging data available through NHGRI's Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space ([AnVIL](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanvilproject.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Crotunnom%40mail.nih.gov%7C174a4556686f4e4d263408db7f21bc5c%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638243555091842357%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1qtwNkpfoKlHyEy46F0f1bOBXJ9Tn5JDmODwUhLH%2BAA%3D&reserved=0)).\n\n\n\n**Data Sources**  \n\n\n\nApplicants are encouraged to collaborate with investigators holding publicly as well as non-publicly available data sets, using innovative statistical strategies to harmonize and link methodologically comparable datasets and sharing with the research community the harmonized datasets.\n\n\n\nApplicants are encouraged to leverage the large volume of data publicly available to the scientific community.

        "description": "\"*Depression is a complex biological illness.*\n*We need treatments to match.*\n\n\n\nThe latest worldwide survey of global health underscores the devastating impact of depression. Depression was ranked as the 3rd highest cause of disability across all illnesses, resulting in approximately 43 million years lost to disability (YLD). In only a single year, 264 million people suffer from depression, and 800,000 lives are lost to suicide. Narrowing in on the United States, almost 7% of adults experience an episode of depression each year, costing an estimated $210.5 billion due to the combination of treatment costs and productivity loss. Consistent with this enormous disease burden, the NIH has spent over $22 billion on depression research over the last 20 years - more than for any other mental illness, including addiction, schizophrenia, or autism. But despite this massive investment, only 1 in 3 patients substantially responds to currently available medication or psychotherapy treatments.\n\n\n\n**Why are we stuck?** The modern practices of psychiatry and psychology are grounded in neuroscience and biology. We understand that synaptic connections serve as the currency of neural communication, and that strengthening or weakening these connections can facilitate learning new behavioral strategies and ways of looking at the world. Through studies in both animal models and humans, we have discovered that emotional states are encoded in complex neural network activity patterns, and that directly changing these patterns via brain stimulation can shift mood. We also know that disruption of these delicately balanced networks can lead to neuropsychiatric illness.\n\n\n\nBased on this understanding that psychiatric symptoms are rooted in biology, all existing drug therapies for depression target biological mechanisms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) bind to the serotonin transporter, leading to increased serotonin concentration in the synaptic cleft and a cascade of downstream functional and structural consequences. Although the exact mechanism of action of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine is still being investigated, it is known to be an NMDA-receptor antagonist. Brexanolone, which is the newest FDA-approved antidepressant for the indication of post-partum depression, is a neuroactive steroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor. We have now even solved the crystal structures of psychiatric drugs binding to their targeted receptors. Since at least the 1960's, with the first indications that alterations in levels of catecholamines such as dopamine can lead to depressed mood, we have known that depression is biologically based, and that treatments need to address these underlying biological problems.\n\n\n\n**Yet, these biologically based treatments are not being matched to the biology of the human beings they re being used in.** According to standard treatment guidelines currently recommended by the American Psychiatric Association, the first-line pharmacotherapeutic treatment for depression is a randomly selected SSRI. And if that doesn t work, the next step is switching to another randomly selected SSRI, followed by augmentation with an additional agent or switching to an alternative medication class. It is a brute force process guided almost exclusively by qualitative data and subjective self-report. And the impact of each new medication change can take between 2-6 months to assess. This current state of affairs leads to time lost for both patients and their loved ones, unnecessary side effects, discouragement, and   perhaps most importantly   continued progression towards end-stage illness.\n\n\n\n**What needs to change?** To make meaningful change, we need to match treatments to the specific biology of the people receiving them.\n\n\n\n**Program goals.**\n\n\n\nWe envision a world in which diagnosing anhedonic depression is as straightforward as getting a mammogram, and stratification into a treatment plan has the same speed as current algorithms after breast biopsy. This necessitates a general shift of mindset in an important way. Depression can be a terminal illness, just like breast cancer. Rapid, targeted intervention is therefore vital to prevent progression. Initially selecting the treatment with the highest likelihood of working for an individual patient based on their specific biology is therefore of high value, because in addition to decreasing the total time of suffering, key goals include avoiding unnecessary side effects and limiting treatment-associated risks. To that end, our goals are to achieve:\n\n\n\n**1. Rapid patient stratification and treatment matching:** \n\nDevelop an integrated model of anhedonic depression capturing both internal biological factors and externally-manifested and quantifiable symptom-correlated biometrics and behavioral measures. This model should stratify people into those who will be treatment sensitive and those who will be treatment resistant with 80% accuracy, consistent with the current 20% false negative rate for mammograms. The model should also be sufficient to match responsive patients to their appropriate treatment regimen rapidly, including novel or existing behavior modification, psychotherapy, medication, and neurostimulation options. Currently 33% of depressed people have significant symptom reduction with the initial treatment selected, while an additional 21-33% of people require between 2-4 treatment trials to achieve remission. Our goal is to double the number of people who receive an effective treatment on the first try.\n\n    1a. The model should capture multiple levels of investigation (e.g. genome, phenome, network connectivity, metabolome, microbiome, reward processing, plasticity levels, HPA axis function).\n\n    1b. The model should seek to leverage high frequency patient-worn or in-home measurements in addition to those obtained in the clinic, hospital, or laboratory.\n\n    1c. The integrated model should predict the relationship between genome, metabolome (particularly, but not exclusively, from CSF), microbiome, and resting-state connectivity to anhedonia symptoms, reward processing, and treatment response in depressed individuals.\n\n    1d. Predictive validity should be verified in new cohorts either held out from existing samples or collected during the study period.\n\n\n\n**2. Identification of mechanisms underlying treatment-resistant anhedonic depression:** \n\nDefine the biological basis of anhedonic depression with the goal of identifying effective treatments for half of non-responsive patients, as measured by a decrease of  50% on current gold-standard suicidality, depression, and anhedonia scales (HAM-D, BDI, SHAPS). We are particularly interested in developing patient-personalized data-driven \"Intensive Care\" treatment regimens   inclusive of both new and existing lifestyle, drug, psychotherapy, and device interventions   that reduce suicide risk in the top quintile of patient severity. High density behavioral measures should be used in this high-risk population to intensively track symptoms and environmental factors (exercise, sleep, social interactions, etc.) in those who are the most likely to progress to terminal illness, with a goal of developing patient-controlled  alarms  to trigger suggestions to seek help or more intensive interventions. Our intent is to have the same impact on the survivability of severe, treatment-resistant depression that advances in diagnostics and treatment have had on the survivability of breast cancer. Namely, we want 85% of people to survive their suicidal anhedonic depression for at least 5 years  and perhaps a full lifetime  after diagnosis.\"",

Organizations applying to PACG may request funding for general operating support, or project support.*\n\n\n\n**Positive Action Grants Overview**\n\n\n\nThrough Positive Action Grants, ViiV Healthcare supports community-led efforts to disrupt disparities to increase engagement in prevention and care, address stigma, build trust, and elevate the voices of those communities most disproportionately impacted by HIV.\n\n\n\nAs our most recent three-year Positive Action grant cycle comes to a close, ViiV Healthcare's Positive Action Grants is currently requesting one- and three-year proposals to support the health and well-being of people living with HIV and people with reasons for prevention through innovative, community-led solutions that address disparities in the epidemic and link people to care.\n\nNew in 2024, ViiV Healthcare will launch a single RFP to collect proposals. This RFP will encompass all previous Positive Action Programs (accelerate, AMP Grant, Positive Action Community Grants, Positive Action for Youth, Positive Action for Women, Positive Action for LatinX Men, Positive Action Southern Initiative, and Risk to Reasons).\n\nOur Approach and Priorities Since our beginning, ViiV Healthcare s Positive Action programs have worked to reduce stigma and improve access to care for communities disproportionately impacted by HIV in the United States. Based on listening sessions with community members, ViiV Healthcare  is committed to supporting organizations working with the following key populations most impacted by HIV:\n\n\n\n-    Black men (gay, bisexual, queer, and trans)\n\n\n\n-    Black, Latinx, and indigenous women (cis & trans) 1\n\n\n\n-    Young people living with HIV\n\n\n\n-    Latinx men (gay, bisexual, queer, and trans)\n\n\n\n-    Organizations working in the following locations, the Southern United States, or other resource deserts:\n\n    -    o Alabama: all cities o DMV: District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia o Florida: Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee o Georgia: Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah o Illinois: Chicago o Louisiana: Baton Rouge, New Orleans o Mississippi: Jackson o Missouri: St. Louis o North Carolina: Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham o South Carolina: Columbia o Tennessee: Memphis, Nashville o Texas: Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston o Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n-    Other populations with demonstrated need \n\n\n\nOrganizations applying to Positive Action Grants may request funding in the following three categories:\n\n\n\n/ General operating support (no maximum) for core support and mission-driven community-based work.\n\n/ Project support (maximum $250,000 per year) for organizations implementing innovative projects within ViiV Healthcare s three focus areas, which should be tailored for your key population focus (if you have one):\n\n\n\nLinkage and Engagement:  Services are those that provide people living with and vulnerable to HIV with referrals and resources, health literacy and self-advocacy skills, and direct support for their access and sustained engagement in HIV prevention, care, treatment and supportive services. ViiV Healthcare is particularly interested in efforts that:\n\n\n\n-      Invest in navigation efforts that support clients through their lived experiences by sharing resources, navigation insights learned from personal experience and/or training, and emotional support that promotes hope and trust.\n\n-      Create strong prevention infrastructure for key populations, fueling new ways to reach and engage people in HIV prevention.\n\n-      Support for the development and/or implementation of holistic professional/workforce development opportunities for peer navigators and community health workers.\n\n-      Support for programs that provide resources for the day-to-day needs of peer navigators and community health workers.\n\n-      Support for peer navigators and community health workers to implement a variety of innovative efforts, inclusive of the social determinants of health, to reach and engage people more broadly and holistically.\n\n\n\nNetworks for People Living with HIV or Vulnerable to HIV and for Organizations:\n\n-      Networks for People Living with HIV or Vulnerable to HIV are formal or informal groups that meet regularly (more than once a year), in-person, virtually, or both. The goals are to: create or strengthen relationships; increase self-advocacy; share information; develop skills; reduce isolation; increase reach and use of resources to support engagement in prevention, treatment and care.\n\n\n\n    -    Support the development and strengthening of safer/brave spaces that validate identities, and build and provide opportunities to connect with holistic, culturally resonant health and supportive care.\n\n    \n\n    -    Support for activities and events that elevate the important role that families and allies play in dismantling stigma, homophobia and transphobia that keep people from actualizing their health and wellness goals.\n\n-      Networks for Organizations are formal or informal groups that include representatives of organizations. Groups meet regularly (more than once a year), in-person, virtually, or both, to improve service delivery systems, resources or approaches that support access and sustained engagement in prevention, care, treatment and supportive services for people living with or vulnerable to HIV.\n\n\n\n    -    Support training opportunities for safer space facilitators in trauma-informed care and other restorative justice and healing-based work.\n\n    \n\n    -    Support for leadership development and fellowship programs that offer tangible and focused skills development, career mentoring and networking opportunities\n\n    \n\n    -    Support, strengthen and connect community-led organizations and coalitions to enhance the coordinated local and national response to HIV\n\n    \n\n    -    Improve the capacity of organizations to provide culturally competent and affirming care that meets the unique needs of key populations.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy: Activities are campaigns, leadership strengthening, insights gathering and dissemination, narrative change and culture project efforts that effect policy change, reduce stigma, and improve access and strengthen systems of prevention and care for people living with and vulnerable to HIV.\n\n\n\nViiV Healthcare is particularly interested in efforts that:\n\n-      Expand harm reduction services and advocacy to successfully engage people who use drugs in care, and support their families and communities.\n\n-      Support the decriminalization of HIV at the local and national level.\n\n-      Increase access to quality and culturally responsive sexual health education.\n\n-      Activate arts and culture as a tool for community engagement, connection, and reducing stigma.\n\n-      Increase access to and awareness of the mental health needs of people living with or vulnerable to HIV.\n\n\n\nOrganizations will continue to be supported by LINK Learning Communities where organizations can come together to share best practices and lessons learned.\n\n/ AMP Grant (maximum $350,000 per year): Knowing small or local projects often can t access traditional funding sources, and that innovation is often found at the grassroots level, AMP Grant Leads act as an incubator to cohorts of innovative individuals, projects or small organizations leading outreach and engagement efforts that reach people living with or vulnerable to HIV. As part of an expanded effort to place resources directly in the hands of community, AMP Grant Leads provide funds, capacity building, technical assistance, mentorship and more.

By reducing air and water pollution, New ERA funding improves health outcomes and lower energy costs for people in rural communities. New ERA program funding is available to member-owned rural electric cooperatives, which have been the backbone of America's rural power delivery for nearly a century.\n\n\n\nThis $9.7 billion program is part of the Inflation Reduction Act and represents the largest investment in rural electrification since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**How can funds be used?**\n\nFunds can be used to make energy efficiency improvements to eligible generation and transmission systems, to purchase, build, or deploy renewable energy, zero-emission systems, carbon capture storage systems, or to purchase renewable energy.\n\n\n\nThe New ERA program is designed to be flexible. The program prioritizes greenhouse gas reductions rather than requiring the use of specific technologies. For example, you can seek funding for renewable and zero-emission systems that eliminate aging, obsolete, or expensive infrastructure. You can also change your purchased-power mixes to support cleaner portfolios, manage stranded assets, and boost your transition to clean energy.\n\n\n\nApplications will be scored and ranked on the greatest reduction in cost-per-unit measure of greenhouse gases. Projects must be reliable, resilient (able to recover quickly following an unexpected disruption), and affordable. The cost of unit of reduction will be considered. We encourage applicants to think ambitiously! Maximize your technical options to bring about the greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to create jobs and economic opportunity, and improve the quality of life in your rural communities.\n\n\n\nCategory 2: Total utility plant value more than $200 million and less than $500 million\n\n\n\n-   **Grant only:** Applicants can apply for a grant only that equals no more than 25 percent of the total project cost. Applicants would have to demonstrate the ability to meet the remaining 75 percent of the project cost.\"",

The telescope and its instruments were built under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Management of JWST's scientific program is carried out by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). We anticipate allocating up to 5,000 hours in this cycle. In Cycle 2, the split between size categories was 2,350 hours for [Small programs (  25 hours)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories), 1,750 for [Medium programs (> 25 and   75 hours)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories), and 900 for [Large programs (> 75 hours)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories). The Cycle 3 allocations are subject to adjustment based on proposal pressure. Abstracts of previously accepted programs can be found on the [JWST proposal catalogs webpage](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs).\n\n\n\nJWST observations can be requested with [General Observer (GO) Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-goproposals), Survey proposals, or through [Director's Discretionary (DD) Time Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/past-jwst-proposal-opportunities/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-1/jwst-cycle-1-proposal-categories/director-s-discretionary-dd-time-proposals). GO proposal categories include Small, Medium, Large, Calibration, Long-Term, Treasury, and hybrid GO-Archival. Survey programs consist of similar, relatively short observations of a targets drawn from a large sample; unlike GO programs, Survey programs have no guaranteed completion fraction. Funding for JWST-related projects that do not require new JWST observations can be requested with an [Archival Research (AR) Proposal](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-archivalproposals). An AR proposal can be either a Regular AR, Calibration AR, Legacy AR, Theory, Cloud Computing, or a Community Data Science Software Proposal. All GO, Survey, and AR proposals are peer-reviewed by a Telescope Allocation Committee (TAC), as described in [JWST Proposal Selection Procedures](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-selection-procedures). Investigators may request Director's Discretionary (DD) time at any time for unanticipated and scientifically compelling astronomical observations.\n\n\n\n**General Observer (GO) Proposals**\n\n\n\nA GO Proposal may be submitted for any amount of observing time, counted in hours, including all overheads. GO Proposals are classified as [Small (  25 hours)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-smallproposals), [Medium (> 25 and](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-mediumproposals) [ ](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-smallproposals) [75 hours)](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-mediumproposals) and [Large](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-largeproposals) ([\\>](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-mediumproposals)75 hours). The classification into these categories is the total charged time for the observatory, including overheads. Proposals in these categories can request observing time in future cycles as a [Long-Term Proposal](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-longtermproposals) when this is scientifically justified, however the program's total time, and hence its category, will be determined from the sum total of time for all cycles in the request. The additional category of [Treasury Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-treasuryproposals) is designed to stimulate certain types of ambitious and innovative proposals that may not naturally fit into the Small, Medium, or Large Proposal categories.\n\n\n\nThere are also opportunities to apply for [Joint Observing programs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-jointobservingprograms) to obtain multi-wavelength data and [Calibration Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-calibrationproposals) to provide calibrations for non-standard instrumentation modes. \n\n\n\nProposers should note that all JWST observations are accepted with the understanding that the timescale on which the observations will actually be obtained will depend on scheduling opportunities and demands on JWST resources. Programs with scheduling constraints may require execution over a period that may extend into the next Cycle.\n\n\n\nIn general, proposals are either accepted or rejected in their entirety. Accordingly, proposers are urged to request the actual number of hours required to achieve the proposal science goals. Laboratory astrophysics relevant to JWST observations is an acceptable component of a GO proposal.\n\n\n\nGround-based observations that complement JWST observations may also be included as a component of a GO proposal, but note that these observations are generally obtained independently, as STScI does not award time on ground-based facilities except for [Joint Observing programs](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-jointobservingprograms) awarded as part of this Call.\n\n\n\nProposals may include a citizen science component, ground-based observations and laboratory astrophysics in support of the science goals. Funded support for those activities must be compliant with the JWST [General Grant Provisions](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/scientific-community/grants-administration/_documents/general-grants-provisions-revB.pdf) and is limited to no more than 10% of the total budget. [NASA document SPD-33](https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SPD-33-Signed.pdf) provides guidelines on citizen science projects. \n\n\n\n**Small GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nSmall GO Proposals are those that request less than or equal to 25 hours of total time. 2,350 hours were allocated to Small Proposals in Cycle 2. The Cycle 3 allocation is subject to adjustment based on proposal pressure. Small Proposals will have a default exclusive access period of 12 months.\n\n\n\n**Medium GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nMedium GO Proposals are those that request above 25 hours but less than or equal to 75 hours of total time. The Medium Proposal category exists to ensure that compelling science programs that demand a medium-size hour request have appropriate opportunities for success. In Cycle 2, 1,750 hours were allocated to GO medium proposals. The Cycle 3 allocation is subject to adjustment based on proposal pressure. Medium Proposals will have a default exclusive access period of 12 months.\n\n\n\n**Large GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nLarge Proposals are those that request more than 75 hours of total time. These programs should lead to a clear advance in our understanding in an important area of astronomy. They must use the unique capabilities of JWST to address scientific questions in a comprehensive approach that is not possible in smaller time allocations. Selection of a Large Proposal for implementation does not rule out acceptance of Small or Medium Proposals to do similar science, and vice versa.  But, as with all programs, target duplication and overall program balance will be considered.\n\n\n\n900 hours were allocated to Large and Treasury Proposals in Cycle 2. The Cycle 3 allocation is subject to adjustment based on proposal pressure. Data taken for Large Proposals will, by default, have no exclusive access period. Proposals may request an exclusive access period; that request should be justified in the \"Special Requirements\" section of the proposal and will be subject to TAC review.\n\n\n\n**Long-Term GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nSmall, Medium, Large, and Treasury GO Proposals may request JWST observing time in more than one cycle if a clear scientific case can be made. Long-Term Proposals must be limited to cases where long-baseline, multi-epoch observations are clearly required to achieve the scientific goals. Long-Term Proposals require a long time baseline, but not necessarily a large number of JWST hours, to achieve their science goals. Examples include astrometric observations or long-term monitoring of variable stars or active galactic nuclei. \n\n\n\nProposers may request time in up to three cycles (3, 4, and 5). Long-term Proposals should describe  in the PDF Attachment the entire requested program and provide a cycle-by-cycle breakdown of the number of hours requested. The review panels and TAC will only be able to award a limited amount of time in future cycles, so a detailed scientific justification for allocating time beyond Cycle 3 must be presented. **Scheduling concerns are not a sufficient justification.** The sum of all hours requested in Cycles 3, 4, and 5 determines whether a Long-Term Proposal is Small, Medium, or Large, with the appropriate exclusive access periods applied (12 months for Small and Medium, and 0 months for Large). **The cycle-by-cycle breakdown needs to be entered in the APT coversheet using the \"Future Cycles\" menu.** If this field is not marked and filled out, the Long-term request might not be met, even if it is described in the proposal. **The APT file should only contain the observations corresponding to the current cycle.** APT files for time awarded in Future Cycles will be requested at a later time.\n\n\n\nTarget-of-Opportunity Proposals are eligible to be Long-Term for rare phenomena if certain conditions are met (see [JWST Observation Types](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-observation-types)). GOs with approved Long-Term Proposals are not required to submit continuation proposals for subsequent cycles.\n\n\n\n**Treasury GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nTreasury Proposals are those designed to create JWST datasets of lasting scientific value. A Treasury Program is defined by the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n-   The program should focus on the potential to solve multiple scientific problems with a single, coherent dataset. It should enable a variety of compelling scientific investigations.\n\n-   The program should produce data products that are processed or calibrated significantly beyond the capabilities of the JWST Calibration Pipeline to maximize the scientific impact of the program. Examples include tiled images, multi-band object catalogs, or coordinated observations on other facilities (for which some funding can be provided). Funding for the proposed data products will depend on their timely availability. They should be delivered to STScI in suitable digital formats for dissemination via MAST.\n\n-   Data taken under a Treasury Program will usually have no exclusive access period, although brief exclusive access periods may be requested if that will enhance the public data value. Such requests are subject to TAC approval.\n\n\n\nThe following additional characteristics are particularly encouraged:\n\n\n\n-   Development of new techniques for data reduction or analysis.\n\n-   Creation and dissemination of tools (software, Web interfaces, models, etc.), beyond what is offered to the community by STScI, for the scientific community to work with the data products.\n\n\n\nThe emphasis will be on observations whose value is maximal if taken in the current cycle. However, Treasury Proposals may request observing time to be distributed in future cycles if scientifically required (similar to the situation for Small, Medium, and Large Long-Term GO Proposals). In Cycle 3 approximately 850 hours of JWST time will be available for Large and Treasury Proposals. Treasury Programs will be selected by the TAC as part of the normal peer review process. Investigators submitting Treasury Proposals must select the Treasury Program flag on the APT cover page and include additional technical details on the scheduling aspects of their program in the \"Description of the Observations  section in APT. Treasury programs can be Small, Medium or Large proposals. \n\n\n\nThe \"Scientific Justification\" section of the proposal should include a description of the scientific investigations that will be enabled by the final data products and their importance. The \"Technical Justification\" section of the proposal should not only include a detailed rationale of the observations, but also plans for data analysis and a description of how the data products will be made available to STScI and the community, the method of dissemination, and a realistic time line.\n\n\n\n**Calibration GO Proposals**\n\n\n\nJWST is a complex observatory, with many possible instrument configurations. Calibrations and calibration software are maintained by STScI for the most important and most used configurations. However, STScI does not have the resources to calibrate fully all potential capabilities of all instruments. Additionally, the astronomical community has expressed interest in receiving support to perform calibrations for certain uncalibrated or poorly calibrated modes, or to develop specialized software for certain JWST calibrations. In recognition of this, STScI is encouraging users to submit Calibration Proposals, which aim to fill gaps in the calibration of JWST and its instruments.\n\n\n\nCalibration Proposals should not be linked to a specific science program, but should provide a calibration or calibration software that can be used by the community for existing or future programs. A specific science program that has special calibration requirements is not a Calibration Proposal; such a proposal should be submitted as a normal GO Proposal and the necessary calibration observations should be included in the science program. Users submitting Calibration Proposals **must** contact the appropriate instrument team at STScI (via [the helpdesk](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-help-desk)) to discuss their program prior to submission. Failure to do so will result in automatic rejection of the proposal.\n\n\n\nSuccessful proposers will be required to deliver documentation, data products and/or software to STScI to be made available to the community to support future observing programs or archival research. Funding is available to support Calibration Proposals in the same manner as for normal science programs, with the following exception: **Scientists affiliated with STScI are not eligible for any funding to support their role (as PI or Co-I) in a Calibration Proposal.**\n\n\n\nCalibration Proposals will be reviewed internally at STScI by the Instruments Division. The internal review will provide the TAC with an assessment of the feasibility of the proposal, how the proposal complements/extends the existing calibration program, and the type of science impacted by the proposed calibrations. Proposers should summarize the relevance and overall scientific utility of the calibration techniques and products described in their proposal.\n\n\n\nInvestigators interested in submitting a Calibration Proposal are encouraged to study the JWST User Documentation to determine the level at which STScI provides calibration and characterization. The data obtained for a GO Calibration Proposal will nominally have no exclusive access period, as is the case for regular calibration observations. Proposers may request an exclusive access period (which should be explained in the \"Special Requirements\" section of the proposal), but such a request will be subject to panel and TAC review and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Calibration Proposals cannot be submitted as Survey Proposals. Calibration Proposals can be submitted as Archival Proposals. Calibration AR Proposals are appropriate in cases where the necessary data have already been taken, or for programs that do not require specific data but aim to develop specialized software for certain JWST calibration and data reduction tasks.\n\n\n\n**Combined GO-Archival Programs**\n\n\n\nIn past cycles, we required separate GO and AR proposals for programs that included new observations and substantial analysis of JWST archival data so that both could be funded at an appropriate level.  **We are now offering the GO-Archival option for research programs where substantial effort (>10%) will be devoted analyzing JWST archival data. GO-Archival proposals should include an Analysis Plan for the archival data.**\n\n\n\nPrograms that require funding for Archival Research alongside new observations should be submitted as a single GO Proposal, regardless of the relative size of the Archival component. Both the GO and the Archival science must be clearly described and justified.\n\n\n\nProposers should select the GO-Archival flag in APT to identify the combined nature of the proposal.\n\n\n\nThe GO categories Small, Medium, Large, Calibration, Long-Term, or Treasury are all permitted; proposals sizes will be determined by the GO orbit request. The chosen GO category determines the page limit for the PDF attachment.\n\n\n\nProposers will also be able to select an appropriate AR flags for the proposal, as described in this page.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n**Archival Research (AR) Proposals**\n\n\n\nObservations that are no longer in the exclusive access period are freely available for analysis by scientists through retrieval from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). For JWST Cycle 3, this includes all [Director's Discretionary Early Release Science](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs) datasets, which have no exclusive access period, and some approved GO and [GTO program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-gto) datasets. AR proposals may be submitted by non-US PIs if there are US co-Is who request funding.\n\n\n\nThe JWST Archival Research (AR) Program can provide financial support for the analysis of such data sets (as [Regular or Legacy AR proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-archivalproposals)), or the theory (as [AR Theory](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-artheoryproposals)), or cloud computing (as [Cloud Computing Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-arcloudcomputingstudies)), or science software (as [Community Data Science Software Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-ardatasciencesoftwareproposals)) which maximize their use. There is also an opportunity to support calibration activities (as [Calibration AR Proposals](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-3/jwst-proposal-categories#JWSTProposalCategories-calibrationarproposals)) beyond what is produced by the standard calibration pipeline. All AR Proposals must include an analysis plan. Proposals for AR funding are considered at the same time, and by the same reviewers, as proposals for observing time, on the same basis. Laboratory astrophsyics and citizen science are acceptable components of archival proposals. \n\n\n\nAR proposals may include a citizen science component, ground-based observations and laboratory astrophysics in support of the science goals. Funded support for those activities must be compliant with the JWST [General Grant Provisions](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/scientific-community/grants-administration/_documents/general-grants-provisions-revB.pdf) and is limited to no more than 10% of the total budget. [NASA document SPD-33](https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SPD-33-Signed.pdf) provides guidelines on citizen science projects. \n\n\n\n**Regular AR Proposals**\n\n\n\nThe general goal of a Regular AR Proposal is to analyze a subset of data from JWST to address a specific scientific issue. In general, the scientific questions addressed should differ from those tackled by the original programs that obtained the data. A strong justification must be given to reanalyze data if the new project has the same science goals as the original proposal. There is no limit to the amount of funding that may be requested in a Regular AR Proposal. For reference, it is expected that the majority of awards will fall under $150,000, with a median of about $75,000. However, STScI actively encourages the submission of more ambitious AR programs (Regular and Legacy) for which larger amounts of funding may be justified. Budget plans should be commensurate with the level of work required to carry out the goals of the proposal.  \n\n\n\n**Legacy AR Proposals**\n\n\n\nA Legacy AR Proposal is defined by the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n-   The project should perform a homogeneous analysis of a well-defined subset of data from JWST in MAST.\n\n-   The main goal should be to provide a homogeneous set of calibrated data and/or ancillary data products to the scientific community.\n\n-   The results of the project should enable a variety of new and important types of scientific investigations.\n\n\n\nWe encourage the development of open source community software tools for dissemination to the community.\n\n\n\n**The main difference between a Regular and a Legacy AR Proposal is that the former aims at performing a specific scientific investigation, while the latter will also create data products and/or tools for the benefit of the community.** While Legacy AR Proposals will be judged primarily on the basis of scientific merit, the importance and broad applicability of the products produced by the Legacy Proposal will be key features in judging the overall scientific merit of the proposal.\n\n\n\nIt is a strict requirement for Legacy AR Proposals that the proposed data products be created and distributed to the community in a timely manner. Data products should also be delivered to STScI in a format consistent with the [MAST High-Level Science products Contributions Guidelines](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/hlsp_guidelines.html) for dissemination via MAST.\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that Legacy AR Proposals will be larger in scope and requested funds than most Regular AR Proposals. While there is no lower limit on the requested amount of funding, it is expected that most Legacy AR Proposals will require at least $150,000, and possibly up to a few times this amount, to accomplish their goals. Commensurate with the expected scope, Legacy AR Proposals are allowed to be multi-year projects, although this is not a requirement. Multi-year projects will be funded on a yearly basis, with continued funding beyond the first year subject to a performance review. Legacy AR Proposals will be evaluated by the TAC in conjunction with Large and Treasury GO Proposals.\n\n\n\nThe \"Scientific Justification\" section of the proposal should include a description of the scientific investigations that will be enabled by the final data products, and their importance. The \"Analysis Plan\" section should describe the plans for data analysis, the data products that will be made available to STScI and the community, the method of dissemination, and a realistic timeline.\n\n\n\n**Calibration AR Proposals**\n\n\n\nCalibration Proposals may be submitted as AR Proposals. Calibration AR Proposals are appropriate in cases where the necessary data have already been taken, or for programs that do not require specific data but aim to develop specialized software for certain JWST calibration and data reduction tasks. Users submitting Calibration Proposals must contact the appropriate instrument group (accessible via the [JWST Help desk](https://jwsthelp.stsci.edu)) to discuss their program prior to submission.\n\n\n\n**AR Theory Proposals**\n\n\n\nProposers may request financial support for for theoretical research that is relevant to the JWST mission, and that will have a lasting benefit for current or future observational programs with JWST.\n\n\n\nA Theory Proposal should address a topic that is of direct relevance to JWST observational programs, and this relevance should be explained in the proposal. Funding of mission-specific research under the JWST Theory Program will be favored over research that is appropriate for a general theory program, such as the NASA Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics Theory Program. The primary criterion for a Theory Proposal is that the results should enhance the value of JWST observational programs through their broad interpretation (in the context of new models or theories) or by refining the knowledge needed to interpret specific observational results (a calculation of atomic cross sections may fall under the latter category). The results of the theoretical investigation should be made available to the community in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\nAs with the other AR Proposals, there is no limit to the funding that may be requested in Theory Proposals. For reference, it is expected that the majority of awards will fall under $150,000, with a median of about $75,000. The effort detailed in the Management Plan of the proposal should be commensurate with the level of funding to be requested in the budget submission. Theoretical research should be the primary or sole emphasis of a Theory Proposal. Analysis of archival data may be included, but should not be the main aim of the project. GO or AR Proposals which include a minor component of theoretical research will be funded under the appropriate GO or AR Program. \n\n\n\nA Theory Proposal may be submitted by a non-U.S. PI if there are one or more U.S. Co-Is who request funding. \n\n\n\nAward amounts for Theory Proposals are anticipated to be similar to those made for Regular AR Proposals. STScI also allows the submission of more ambitious proposals for which larger amounts of funding may be justified.\n\n\n\nThe \"Scientific Justification\" section of the proposal should describe the proposed theoretical investigation and also its impact on observational investigations with JWST. Review panels will consist of observational and theoretical astronomers with a broad range of scientific expertise. They will not necessarily have specialists in all areas of astrophysics, particularly theory, so the proposals must be written for general audiences of scientists. The \"Analysis Plan\" section of the proposal should discuss the types of JWST data that will benefit from the proposed investigation, and references to specific data sets in MAST should be given where possible. This section should also describe how the results of the theoretical investigation will be made available to the astronomical community, and on what time-scale the results are expected.\n\n\n\n**AR Cloud Computing Studies**\n\n\n\nAll non-exclusive access data for JWST instruments (MIRI, NIRCam, NIRSpec, NIRISS), will be made available as part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public dataset program ([aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/](http://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/ \"http://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/\")). Providing these data in close proximity to AWS facilitates new types of compute-intensive analyses that may have not previously been possible due to individual researcher or research group compute resources. Proposals to make use of this dataset should select the Cloud Computing check box next to the AR category in APT, and be prepared to include a line item in their budget for AWS costs (limit $10,000).\n\n\n\nExample use cases for leveraging these data could include: Large scale (re)analyses of data to measure photometric properties or proper motions, computationally-intensive tasks such as training machine learning classifiers, and live community-facing services.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n\n-   Link to JWST data on AWS: [https://registry.opendata.aws/jwst/](https://registry.opendata.aws/jwst/)\n\n-   AWS machine learning services: [aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/](http://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/)\n\n-   AWS spot computing: [aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/spot-and-science/](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/spot-and-science/)\n\n-   Educational & research use cases: [aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/](http://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/)\n\n\n\n**AR Data Science Software Proposals**\n\n\n\nProposers have an opportunity under the JWST AR Program to obtain financial support for the development of software products that will be made available to the community for the purposes of analyzing JWST data. Descriptions of the data products created by the JWST calibration pipeline and related software tools are available on [JWST Data Calibration Considerations](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-data-calibration-considerations), [JWST Science Calibration Pipeline Overview](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline-overview), and [JWST Post-Pipeline Data Analysis](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis). Examples of additional products include, but are not restricted to,\n\n\n\n-   scripts to mitigate artifacts from specific detectors,\n\n-   tools to identify and extract fluxes/magnitudes from multiple sources within a field,\n\n-   utility software for working with JWST data products, \n\n-   or codes to produce background-subtracted spectra or software to interact with JWST archive services.\n\n\n\nPlease contact the Data Science Mission Office ([dsmo@stsci.edu](mailto:dsmo@stsci.edu)) for additional guidance. The primary criterion for a Community Data Science Proposal is that the results should broadly enhance the value of JWST observational products for anyone in the astronomical community. The results of the data science software development should be made available to the community in a timely fashion through an appropriate distribution platform. Open source software using a standard license ([https://opensource.org/licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)) is encouraged. The software should have thorough internal documentation at a level consistent with software best practices, and, if computationally intensive, should be compatible with a cloud computing service. \n\n\n\nThere is no limit to the amount of funding that may be requested, but it is expected that the amounts will be at a similar level to those in the Regular AR category. The effort detailed in the Management Plan section of the proposal should be commensurate with the level of funding requested. \n\n\n\nThe \"Scientific Justification\" section of the proposal should describe the proposed software plan and also its impact on observational investigations with JWST. Review panels will consist of observational and theoretical astronomers with a broad range of scientific expertise. They will not necessarily have specialists in all areas of astrophysics, particularly software development, so the proposals must be written for general audiences of scientists. The \"Analysis Plan\" section of the proposal should discuss the types of JWST data that will benefit from the proposed investigation, and references to specific data sets in MAST should be given where possible. This section should also describe how the results of the investigation will be made available to the astronomical community, and on what time-scale the results are expected.\"",

        "description": "\"Unique among writing programsStegner Fellows are regarded as working artists, intent upon practicing and perfecting their craft. The only requirements are writing and workshop attendance. The fellowship offers no degree. We view it as more of an artist-in-residence opportunity for promising writers to spend two years developing their writing in the company of peers and under the guidance of Stanford [faculty](https://creativewriting.stanford.edu/faculty).\n\n\n\nIn awarding fellowships, we consider the quality of the candidate's creative work, potential for growth, and ability to contribute to and profit from our writing workshops. Our fellows are diverse in style and experience, with talent and seriousness the true common denominators.\n\n\n\n-   We do not require any degrees or tests for admission\n\n-   No school of writing is favored over any other\n\n-   Applicants must be at least 18 years old\n\n\n\nThe Stegner Fellowship is a full-time academic commitment and is not intended to be pursued concurrently with another degree program. The fellowship includes a living stipend, and a fellow's tuition and health insurance are paid for by the Creative Writing Program. A fellow must live close enough to Stanford in order to attend workshops, readings, and events.\n\n\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n\n\nPrimarily, Stegner Fellows are required to attend weekly, faculty-led workshops and to write, revise, and then write again, with the goal of a finished manuscript ready for publication. As part of the workshop, fellows are expected to actively engage with their cohort's work by reading and thoughtfully commenting on pieces presented.\n\n\n\nHowever, to enrich one's fellowship experience, we encourage all fellows to attend various reading events and lecture series hosted by our program. In the past, we ve enjoyed the presence of guest speakers such as Zadie Smith, David Treuer, Gilbert King, Mary Ruefle, and Hilton Als. We also host public readings and colloquiums for our annual visiting [poet-in-residence](https://creativewriting.stanford.edu/people/mohr-visiting-poets) and visiting [writer-in-residence](https://creativewriting.stanford.edu/people/stein-visiting-writers).\n\n\n\nDuring the first year of their fellowship, the fellows participate in the [Stegner Fellow Reading series](https://creativewriting.stanford.edu/events/stegner-fellow-readings), where they give a public reading of their work. It s also possible for fellows to TA undergraduate courses, facilitate writing workshops, and offer special tutorials and independent studies to our undergraduate students.\n\n\n\n**Is residency required?**\n\n\n\nYes, one must live close enough to the Stanford main campus to attend weekly workshops, as well as readings and lectures by the program's visiting poets and writers.\n\n\n\n**Can I keep my full-time job during the fellowship?**\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the fellowship is to give writers as much time as possible to work on their writing, free from the time constraints of full-time employment. Holding a full-time job during the fellowship runs counter to the intention of the program.\"",

        "description": " TurbulenceThe heating of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind is one of the fundamental problems in all of space science. While different scenarios have been proposed to explain the heating of magnetically confined and open regions of the corona, they all rely on the transfer, storage and dissipation of the abundant free energy present in photospheric convection. Free energy can be transferred from the photosphere through the chromosphere and the transition region into the corona both as a Poynting flux, which has two components - one due to emerging magnetic field, and one due to the constant shaking and tangling of magnetic field lines already threading the corona by the photospheric velocity field - and by a mechanical and enthalpy flux related to mass motions (flows and compressive waves). \n\n\n\nThis opportunity concerns the modeling of the different aspects of the energy storage and dissipation in the outer solar atmosphere and wind, to be addressed via analytical modeling and/or numerical simulations, at either the large, MHD scales, or the smaller kinetic scales involving non-linear wave-particle interactions. \n\n\n\nReferences: Rappazzo, F., Velli, M., Einaudi, G. and Dahlburg, R., (2008) Astrophys.

One of the BLM's highest priorities is to promote ecosystem health and one of the greatest obstacles to achieving this goal is the rapid expansion of weeds across public lands. These invasive plants can dominate and often cause permanent damage to natural plant communities. If not eradicated or controlled, noxious weeds will continue to jeopardize the health of public lands and to constrain the myriad activities that occur on them. This program supports projects funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Sections 50221 Resilience, 50222 Ecosystems Restoration and 50303 DOI.\n\nBLM Montana/Dakota Invasive and Noxious Plant Management Programs work to prevent, detect, inventory, control, and monitor weed populations on public lands.\n\n-    Invasive species cost the public millions of dollars in control and management each year and many invasive plants and noxious weeds are highly competitive and have the ability to permanently degrade our public lands.\n\n-    Noxious weeds and invasive species expansion are recognized as the single greatest threat to our native plant communities and the values they provide us.\n\n-    These native plant communities are essential for supporting wildlife habitat, watershed function, recreation opportunities, rural economies and working landscapes.\n\n-    Invasive plants and noxious weeds affect plant and animal communities on farms and ranches, and in parks, waters, forests, natural areas, and backyards in negative ways.\n\n-    Human activity such as trade, travel, and tourism have all increased substantially, escalating the speed and volume of species movement to unprecedented levels.\n\n-    Increased site vulnerability from wildfires that are more frequent and other disturbances is an ongoing challenge to maintaining the integrity of our native plant communities.\n\n-    Noxious weeds are particularly aggressive plants legally designated by states as being injurious to public health, the environment or the economy.\n\n-     Invasive species and noxious weeds adversely affect overall recreational opportunities on public land i.c., hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, watershed health and ecosystem function which result in economic losses in rural and urban communities.\n\n\n\n- Affect adjacent private lands, both rural and urban, causing widespread economic losses to the agricultural industry as well as to other resources.\n\n\n\nBLM Montana/Dakota has an opportunity to work with partner organizations to collaboratively manage and coordinate treatments, inventories, monitoring, education and outreach, and prevention activities to control new infestations and treatment to remove existing infestations of noxious weeds and invasive species to gain efficiencies across multiple jurisdictions.\"",

        "title": "\"Understanding Neurological Effects of COVID-19 and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (R01 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-NS-23-021  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major public health concern and remains as the third leading cause of death in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Extraordinary advancements have been made regarding the surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants and the development of vaccines and therapeutics for acute COVID-19 infection. Despite these advances, there is growing evidence that more than half of people infected with COVID-19 continue to experience a spectrum of symptoms beyond the acute phase, a condition now termed \"Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC)\" and also called \"Long COVID\", \"long-haul COVID\", and \"post-acute COVID-19\". Acute COVID and PASC-related symptoms include cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, endocrine, psychiatric and/or neurological manifestations. PASC symptoms can be mild to highly debilitating and are more likely in those who were hospitalized or had severe acute COVID symptoms. However, PASC can occur in people who did not require hospitalization or who were asymptomatic during the acute phase. There are world-wide initiatives to better characterize PASC symptoms and phenotypes, and to uncover its pathophysiology including large scale health surveys and review of large electronic health records as well as large prospective cohort studies that incorporate collection of biospecimens. These studies have identified multiple mechanisms that may play a role in PASC including an ongoing exacerbated inflammatory response, vascular and/or microvascular dysfunction, endothelial disruption, hypercoagulability, persistent viral reservoirs, SARS-CoV2-evoked autoimmunity, viral neurotropism and others. Substantial further work is needed to link these mechanisms to specific symptomatology and complications and to develop effective preventative measures and treatments. \n\n\n\n**COVID-19, PASC and Neurological Complications:** Neurological symptoms have a high incidence and prevalence among individuals with acute COVID-19 and PASC. Acute manifestations of SARS-CoV2 infection include encephalopathy, seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome and stroke, especially in patients who are severely ill and require hospitalization and ICU care. In PASC, commonly reported neurological symptoms include \"brain fog\" characterized by difficulty with cognition, concentration and focus, neuropathic-like pain, headache, myalgia, fatigue, neurocognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, dysautonomia, dizziness, mood disorders and others. There is also growing evidence that COVID-19 may increase the risks of developing neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and epilepsy in the long term. Underlying pre-COVID vascular and immunological conditions appear to predispose the development of PASC which can worsen a pre-existing neurologic condition or trigger a new onset of neurological manifestations. Lack of understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying the development of neurological symptoms has been a major obstacle for the identification of effective treatments for PASC-related neurological complications. \n\n\n\n**National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)**\n\n\n\nThe mission of [NINDS](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease for all people. The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to invite research applications focused on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (neuro-COVID) and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (neuro-PASC) and on the effect of COVID-19 on pre-infection neurologic conditions. NINDS will accept adequately powered applications and of sufficient scope to investigate the pathophysiology and mechanisms of neuro-COVID and neuro-PASC as well as mechanistic clinical trials probing the biological or behavioral processes implicated neuro-COVID and/or neuro-PASC. NINDS will not accept clinical trials to develop therapeutic interventions, to test the safety and/or tolerability of an intervention, to demonstrate pharmacodynamic or neurodynamic effects to establish dosing or to demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention through this NOFO (see non-responsive criteria below). Applicants interested in evaluating treatments for clinical efficacy should apply through one of the NINDS NOFOs listed at the [NINDS Funding-Opportunities](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Find-Funding-Opportunities) to find the appropriate NIH or NINDS-specific NOFO for such clinical trials.\n\n\n\nWhen appropriate, this NOFO strongly encourages applications that include a plan for stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder engagement in clinical studies involves patients, families, their representatives, health professionals, and the clinical research team working in active partnership at various levels across the continuum of clinical research. Continued respectful, equitable, and bidirectional knowledge transfer during stakeholder engagement can improve participant retention and adherence to the study protocol. Engagement can help build trust in communities that may be fearful of participating in clinical research because of stigmas and medical mistrust. \n\n\n\nNINDS is committed to reducing the disproportionate burden of neurological disease borne by underserved groups of society, including racial and ethnic minority, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Persons from racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, including experiencing increased risk for infection, hospitalization, and death. Additionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are more likely to be at risk for poorer health outcomes. Therefore, ensuring appropriate inclusion of populations that experience health disparities is strongly encouraged, when applicable. \n\n\n\nNINDS strongly encourages applicants to consult with NINDS Program Officials to ensure the suitability of the application for this NOFO.\n\n\n\n**Examples of research activities include (but are not limited to) the following:**\n\n\n\n-  Identification of mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations of COVID-19 and PASC.\n\n-  Identification of persistent SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs and evidence of chronic immune dysregulation or viral re-activation in relation to neurologic symptomatology.\n\n-  Research on CNS or PNS-specific tissue-associated autoantibodies and correlation with neurologic clinical parameters including severity and duration of symptoms.\n\n-  Longitudinal correlation of specific inflammatory biomarkers and PASC-related neurological complications.\n\n-  Research evaluating brain endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy and vasculopathy and the effects of potential protective agents on neurologic symptoms.\n\n-  Development and validation of biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction in PASC that may relate to neurologic symptoms.\n\n-  Research to better understand the neuropathobiology of COVID-19 and PASC in the context of SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n-  Understanding overlapping mechanisms of COVID-19/PASC and other chronic conditions with similar neurologic symptomatology, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue (ME/CFS) syndrome, Ebola, Lyme disease, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or connective tissue disorders.\n\n-  Studies to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pre-existing neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, migraine, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, and traumatic brain injury \n\n-  Development and validation of animal models replicating neuro-PASC. \n\n-  Neuropathological studies of COVID-19 and the contribution of tissue damage by SARS-CoV-2 to PASC-related neurological complications.\n\n\n\n**National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)**\n\n\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health ([NIMH](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/)) accepts research to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illness through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. For this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the NIMH is interested in supporting mental health research questions related to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and those arising from Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC). NIMH research areas of interest include 1) exploring mechanisms and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC contributing to new and worsening mental illness outcomes, 2) identifying modifiable targets uniquely or robustly implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC and relevant to new and worsening mental illness, and 3) conducting mechanistic trials probing the biological or behavioral processes of those targets that may be pursued in future mental health therapeutic development. Basic and translational research are relevant but note that for this NOFO, NIMH only allows mechanistic clinical trials (see [NOT-MH-20-105](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-20-105.html) Consolidated Notice on NIMH Clinical Trial Policies and related announcement for intervention development). NIMH will not accept clinical trials to develop therapeutic interventions, to test the safety and/or tolerability of an intervention, to demonstrate pharmacodynamic or neurodynamic effects to establish dosing or to demonstrate the efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention through this NOFO (see non-responsive criteria below). Applicants interested in evaluating treatments for clinical efficacy should apply through one of the NIMH NOFOs listed at the [Support for Clinical Trials at NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas) web page, which includes links to the [NIMH clinical trials NOFOs and Applicant FAQs](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas#part_156840). Applications that propose a clinical trial for the purpose of testing the safety and/or clinical efficacy of novel interventions are outside of the scope of NIMH research interests for this NOFO and will not be supported through this NOFO. Projects focused on broad neurological effects (including brain fog, general memory deficits, and general neural functioning) outside of the context of mental illness should be directed to NINDS. Projects focused on mental illness (including psychosis, depression, anxiety) should be directed to NIMH. For the purposes of this RFA, the NIMH has interest in:\n\n\n\n-  Research establishing experimental systems to model SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection contributing to mental illness specifically and/or mental health related outcomes.\n\n-  Studies of SARS-CoV-2-specific maternal immune responses and signaling in CNS development and function in offspring.\n\n-  Studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and PASC affecting brain endothelial cells, brain lymphatics and glial cells responsible for triggering cognitive and emotional deficits, including the impact of stress, hormonal influences as well as sex effects in experimental systems relevant to mental illness.\n\n-  Studies to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the neuro-immune milieu and the resulting disruption of neuronal circuits, function, or behavior relevant to mental health.\n\n-  Studies to identify mechanisms by which people with mental illness are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death.\n\n-  Mechanistic clinical trials (see [NOT-MH-20-105](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-20-105.html)) to probe the relevance of therapeutic targets uniquely or robustly implicated specific to COVID-19 and mental illness.\n\n-  Studies to clarify the role of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection and mental illness in PASC.\n\n-  Studies elucidating the pathogenesis of the mental illness characteristic of PASC.\n\n-  Host and environmental factors and the associated biological pathways that mediate the intensity and duration of mental illness dimensions of PASC, and affect recovery.\n\n\n\nNIMH strongly encourages applicants to consult with NIMH Program Officials when developing plans for an application. This early contact will provide an opportunity to clarify NIMH policies and guidelines and identify whether the proposed project is consistent with NIMH mission and program priorities. This is particularly important if there is doubt as to whether the submission is determined to be an NIH-defined clinical trial, and if found to be a clinical trial, whether it is a mechanistic clinical trial as defined by NIMH. Studies proposing to model SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection contributing to mental illness specifically and/or mental health related outcomes should align with the guidance provided in [NOT-MH-19-053](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-053.html) Notice of NIMH's Considerations Regarding the Use of Animal Neurobehavioral Approaches in Basic and Pre-clinical Studies. \n\n\n\n**The National Institute on Aging (NIA)**\n\n\n\nNIA encourages applications under this NOFO that address research questions central to NIA's mission of improving the health and well-being of older adults through research. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: \n\n\n\n-  Research on mechanisms underlying neurological and neurocognitive symptoms and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults across the full range of illness severity (e.g., early alterations in sensory function, delirium, neuropsychiatric symptoms). \n\n-  Studies to better understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pre-existing age-related neurodegeneration, including AD/ADRD. \n\n-  Studies of the role of brain barriers in preventing SARS-CoV-2 from gaining access to neural tissues in the context of aging and age-related neurodegeneration; mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 compromises brain barriers and propagates in the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n-  Research on genetic risk or protective factors that may alter cognitive function in older adults who have been afflicted with COVID-19.\n\n-  Neuropathological studies of COVID-19 and the contribution of brain tissue damage by SARS-CoV-2 to the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in older adults. \n\n-  Drug discovery research and development of novel drugs, as well as re-purposing and repositioning existing drugs, for preventing and treating PASC in older adults, particularly drugs specific for COVID-19 related CNS targets and CNS mechanisms driving the viral-mediated pathophysiology, and research on blood-brain-barrier penetrant drug candidates to treat potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in the CNS.\n\n-  Research to develop novel models for investigating concurrent aging and neurodegenerative processes in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO:**\n\n\n\nApplications proposing the following will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and will not be reviewed:\n\n\n\n-  Development of a therapeutic intervention.\n\n-  Testing the safety and/or tolerability of an intervention and/or demonstrating pharmacodynamic or neurodynamic effects to establish dosing.\n\n-  Demonstrating efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention.\n\n-  Exclusively qualitative research.\n\n-  Correlation of patient-reported symptoms and/or neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging that do not carry the potential to identify pathways for the development of treatments.\n\n-  Research targeting post-intensive care syndrome in which it is hard to distinguish what is due to PASC and what is due to critical illness.\n\n-  Research on SARS-CoV-2 virus and PASC unrelated to changes in mental and/or neurological health.\n\n-  Research focused solely on the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection with no implications to PASC.\n\n-  Research of other virus or pathogens with no implications to SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the [Research Methods Resources](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/) website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\"",

Project Description**\n\n\n\n-   The Grantee will operate an Inpatient Forensic Unit by licensed mental health professionals who will provide statewide forensic services for juveniles adjudicated Unfit to Stand Trial (UST) and Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) and are remanded to the Department of Human Services for treatment on an inpatient basis. These services must include, but are not limited to, psychiatric, mental health, substance abuse and dually diagnosed intellectual disability treatment services, as well as, legal education, case management, transportation, court reporting and court testimony. There are to be twelve inpatient beds available for UST and NGRI juveniles. The Inpatient Forensic Unit is designed to:\n\n    -   Provide services to juveniles who are remanded by court order to DHS for forensic services on an inpatient basis.\n\n    -   Increase the prompt access to clinically appropriate inpatient forensic services for individuals adjudicated UST and NGRI who require the restrictiveness of a hospital setting.\n\n-   The Grantee must bill Medicaid/Managed Care Organization (MCO) or other billing source for payment for eligible juveniles. DMH will pay for vacant beds and non-covered juveniles. The Grantee agrees to admit all juveniles remanded (up to twelve) to DMH by the courts for inpatient forensic services. During this contract period, DHS will:\n\n    -   Make the necessary attempts to evaluate a youth, if there is an initial refusal, in order to gather clinical information for Streamwood prior to admission. o Collaborate with the detention center MH staff to encourage a medication assessment prior to admission.\n\n    -   Work with DCFS to develop a process & timeline to place youth in care who have completed restoration treatment so that they are not stuck/stranded at Streamwood with no funding mechanism.\n\n    -   Educate and work directly with the juvenile court judges/attorneys on the \"immediate return\" statute to avoid DCFS and other youth from being boarded at Streamwood.\n\n    -   Assist the provider with transportation services for youth requiring off-site services and/or court.\n\n    -   Work directly with St. Clair and other counties to minimize unnecessary trips and to assure time, date and confirmation of youth's need to appear.\n\n    -   Provide additional Technical Assistance and clinical consultation on cases where youth are not participating in treatment, to advance those cases back to court/detention.\n\n    -   Provide direct assistance with the court to return a youth to detention in clinical emergencies where the behavior (e.g., violence/aggression) is unmanageable in an acute psychiatric hospital environment.\n\n\n\n**5\\.

        "description": "\"**Description**\nThe Environmental Laboratory (EL) is one of the seven laboratories of U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (USACE-ERDC), which is the Army Corps of Engineers' integrated research and development (R&D) organization. EL provides solutions to environmental challenges for the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense and the Nation through environmental science and engineering research and development. Researchers in EL conduct research in ecosystem science and technology, environmental resiliency, environmental sensing, ecological modeling and forecasting, risk and decision science, environmentally sustainable material, systems biology, climate change, computational chemistry, environmental chemistry and environmental security.\n\n\n\nUSACE projects directly influence a diversity of ecological outcomes such as restoration of habitat, impacts to imperiled species populations, movement of migratory organisms, and nutrient dynamics. However, assessments of ecological outcomes typically focus on habitat impacts and benefits (often with 30-40-year-old model USFWS \"blue book\" models). Although habitat models are useful in many contexts and applications, ecological modeling methods have grown to include dozens of approaches that could improve USACE project outcomes from planning through operation. These approaches include statistical methods, systems models, and inductive (machine learning) tools that have been applied to different types of relevant ecological outcomes related to physical processes, population dynamics, community effects, and other outcomes. These ecological modeling tools often more directly measure project objectives and may improve communication regarding restoration benefits. This study examines the next generation of ecological modeling approaches that would help USACE improve decision-making and better \"tell the story\" of its restoration programs.\n\n\n\n**What will I be doing?**\n\n\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, you will collaborate with multidisciplinary USACE and external teams to research and compile cutting-edge ecological modeling approaches and facilitate an ecological modeling workshop with USACE and external scientists working on parallel topics and applied decision context. These activities would help the development of a road map to transitioning methods into USACE practice. You will also review population models and demonstrate their use on an existing USACE project. Results of this research will be documented and communicated through government reports, a journal paper and webinars.\n\n\n\n**Why should I apply?**\n\n\n\nThis fellowship provides the opportunity to independently utilize your skills and engage with experts in innovative ideas to move the proposed research forward.\n\n\n\n**Where will I be located?** Location Varies\n\n\n\n**What is the anticipated start date?**\n\n\n\nExact start dates will be determined at the time of selection and in coordination with the selected candidate.\n\n\n\n**What is the appointment length?**\n\n\n\nThis appointment is a full-time twelve-month research appointment. Appointments may be extended depending on funding availability, project assignment, program rules, and availability of the participant.\n\n\n\n**About ORISE**\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and DoD. Participants do not enter into an employee/employer relationship with ORISE, ORAU, DoD or any other office or agency. Instead, you will be affiliated with ORISE for the administration of the appointment through the ORISE appointment letter and Terms of Appointment. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

        "description": "\"1.0 BACKGROUND \nThe Charge Ready NY Program (Program) is an incentive program designed to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging equipment in New York State. By increasing the use of electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations, this program benefits New York State by reducing harmful emissions and the transportation sector's dependence on petroleum. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) developed the Program to provide incentives that reduce the cost of purchasing and installing qualified Level 2 charging equipment for use in New York State.\n\nNote to Applicants: At the time an Equipment Owner's pre-application or application is approved, the most current version of the Implementation Manual and the Terms and Conditions signed by the Equipment Owner will apply.\n\nThis document constitutes the Implementation Manual for the Program. Definitions of key program parameters are located in the next section of the Manual.\n\n\n\n1.1 PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n\nThe Program is an incentive program that reduces the cost of purchasing and installing qualified Level 2 charging equipment at a New York State location that provides public charging, workplace charging, or charging at a multi-unit dwelling (MUD). Public and private (both forprofit and not-for-profit) entities may participate in the Program. NYSERDA intends to provide incentives of $4,000 per charging port installed upon completion of the installation of charging equipment and the provision of appropriate documentation. Applicants replacing existing charging equipment with new charging equipment are eligible to receive $1,500 per charging port replaced. Equipment owners must install a minimum of two (2) charging ports at each site.\n\nThe Program is initially offering $5 million in funding for incentives and will accept applications until December 31, 2021 or until the program runs out of funds, whichever comes first.\n\nAdditional information about the program, current lists of qualified charging equipment and networks, and the current amount of funding remaining in the program can be found on NYSERDA's website, www.nyserda.ny.gov/charge-ready-ny. Charging equipment and network service eligibility rules are defined in Section 3.1 of this Manual.\n\n\n\nThe Program allows Equipment Owners to participate in one of two ways:\n\n1. Equipment Owners can apply for pre-approval of an incentive payment for the purchase and installation of qualified charging equipment, which reserves funding for their charging equipment. They then must complete their installations and submit required documentation within one-hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the pre-approval date.\n\nUpon approval of all documentation, NYSERDA will issue an incentive payment directly to the Equipment Owner in the form of a paper check or by electronic payment.\n\n2. Equipment Owners can apply for an incentive payment for the purchase and installation of qualified charging equipment after the installation is completed, as long as the installation was completed after the Program Effective Date and the application is submitted within 90 days of the Installation Date. As part of their application, they must submit all required documentation. Upon approval of all documentation, NYSERDA will issue an incentive payment directly to the Equipment Owner in the form of a paper check or by electronic payment.\n\nImportant: Program requirements are determined by NYSERDA which, in its sole discretion reserves the right to make changes to Program elements such as, but not limited to, eligible equipment and networks, incentive amounts, and Equipment Owner requirements.\"",

        "title": "\"Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs Phase I\"",
        "description": "\"**A. Purpose and Priorities**\nThe SBIR and STTR programs are administered by NIFA on behalf of USDA.\n\n\n\nThe SBIR/STTR programs are congressionally mandated and intended to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds to build a strong national economy by stimulating technological innovation in the private sector; strengthening the role of small business in meeting Federal research and development needs; increasing the commercial application of Federally supported research results; and fostering and encouraging participation by historically underserved and women-owned small businesses. Further, the objective of the STTR program is to stimulate formal cooperative partnerships of ideas and technologies between small businesses and nonprofit research institutions ( e.g., Universities, Federal Laboratories). The USDA SBIR/STTR programs are therefore in a unique position to meet both the goals of USDA and the purpose of the SBIR/STTR legislation by transforming scientific discovery and innovation into both social and economic benefit and by emphasizing private sector commercialization.\n\n\n\nBecause the USDA programs currently have no specific procurement focus, USDA offers ten (10) solicitation topic areas that are intended to permit a broad spectrum of eligible and innovative science- and technology-based small businesses to compete for funding. The topics are detailed within Part I   C of this solicitation.\n\n\n\nThese programs are subject to the provisions found at 7 CFR Part 3403. These provisions set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant applications, rules governing the evaluation of applications and the awarding of grants, and regulations relating to the post-award administration of grant projects.\n\n\n\nThe USDA SBIR/STTR programs are carried out in three separate phases. This program solicitation is only for the preparation and submission of SBIR/STTR Phase I applications. The aim of a Phase I project should be to demonstrate technical feasibility of the proposed innovation and thereby bring the innovation closer to commercialization. Proposals should describe the development of an innovation that demonstrates the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n1.Involves a high degree of technical risk - for example, has never been attempted and/or successfully achieved and is still facing technical hurdles (that the USDA-funded R&D work is intended to overcome).\n\n2.Has the potential for significant commercial impact and/or societal benefit as evidenced by having the potential to disrupt the targeted market segment; having good product-market fit (as validated by customers); removing barriers to entry for competition; and offering potential for societal benefit (through commercialization under a sustainable business model).\n\n3.Phase I awards may not exceed the listed maximum award amount for each topic area (listed with specific Program Code) with a project period normally not to exceed eight (8) months for SBIR and twelve (12) months for STTR.\n\n4.The Phase I application should concentrate on research that will significantly contribute to proving the scientific or technical feasibility of the approach or concept, describe the potential market for the innovation, and be a prerequisite to further USDA SBIR/STTR support in Phase II.\n\n\n\nOnly prior Phase I grant recipients are eligible to submit a Phase II application at the conclusion of the Phase I grant period to continue SBIR/STTR funding of the R&D and commercialization of the innovation. Phase II requires a more comprehensive application, outlining the proposed effort and commercialization strategy in detail. USDA SBIR/STTR typically announces the Phase II RFA in early December with a deadline in early March. USDA NIFA recognizes that Phase I and II awards may not be sufficient in either dollars or time for the Small Business Concern (SBC) to complete the total R/R&D and the commercialization activities required to bring the project results to a marketplace. Therefore, completion of the research under these circumstances may have to be carried into Phase III that derives from, extends, or logically concludes effort(s) performed under prior SBIR/STTR funding but is funded by sources other than the SBIR/STTR program, typically from the private sector. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of the SBIR/STTR innovation or technology.\n\n\n\nThe SBIR/STTR Phase I programs are aligned with the following USDA Strategic Goals FY\n\n2022-2026:\n\n\n\nStrategic Goal 1: Combat Climate Change to Support America's Working Lands, Natural Resources and Communities and specifically addresses Objectives 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Strategic Goal 2: Ensure America s Agricultural System is Equitable, Resilient, and Prosperous and specifically addresses Objectives 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.\n\nStrategic Goal 3: Foster an Equitable and Competitive Marketplace for All Agricultural Producers and specifically addresses Objectives 3.1 and 3.2.\n\nStrategic Goal 4: Provide All Americans Safe, Nutritious Food and specifically addresses Objectives 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.\n\nStrategic Goal 5: Expand Opportunities for Economic Development and Improve Quality of Life in Rural and Tribal Communities and specifically addresses Objectives 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.\n\n\n\nGlobal Engagement. NIFA supports global engagement that advances U.S. agricultural goals. NIFA recognizes that collaboration with international partners may be necessary to attain the agency's goals for U.S. agriculture, promote global competence of our nation s future agricultural workforce, and promote safe and nutritious food security in a growing world. Therefore, although application to this RFA is limited to eligible U.S. institutions, applicants may collaborate with international partners, to include subcontracts to international partners or other institutions. Applications must clearly demonstrate benefits to the U.S.\n\n\n\nFor a program informational webinar please visit the NIFA calendar for dates, event registration, and link. If you need a reasonable accommodation to participate in any of the informational webinars listed, please contact the event host listed no later than 10 days prior to the event.\n\n\n\n**B.Program Area Descriptions**\n\n\n\nNIFA is soliciting applications under the following ten SBIR/STTR topics / program areas:\n\n\n\n8.1 Forests and Related Resources\n\n8.2 Plant Production and Protection (Biology)\n\n8.3 Animal Production and Protection\n\n8.4 Conservation of Natural Resources\n\n8.5 Food Science and Nutrition\n\n8.6 Rural and Community Development\n\n8.7 Aquaculture\n\n8.8 Biofuels and Biobased Products\n\n8.12 Small and Mid-size Farms\n\n8.13 Plant Production and Protection (Engineering)\n\n\n\n**1.

Studies will be comprised of data driven modeling, field-based research, and a combination of both field based and modeling.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is offering a funding opportunity to a CESU partner for recruiting and supporting one intern to help guide Tribal-focused applications of project deliverables on a study of grassland bird communities under a changing climate. Over the last half-century, populations of grassland birds declined by more than any other bird group in North America. This is because native grasslands have largely been converted to agricultural row crops, and the remaining prairies have become degraded through altered fire regimes, woody encroachment, the spread of invasive plants, and human development. Land managers and conservation organizations are racing to preserve and restore these ecosystems to stem further loss of grassland birds. Given limited resources, bird habitat models are needed to help managers prioritize where conservation efforts will be most effective. In addition to habitat loss and degradation of native grasslands, increasing greenhouse gas emissions will likely change temperatures and rainfall patterns across the Great Plains. This changing climate is expected to alter vegetation communities and the bird species that depend on them. To date, predictions of bird response to a changing climate have focused on changes in temperature and precipitation, but vegetation productivity also depends on factors such as vegetation type and soils. By studying how vegetation influences grassland birds across the western Great Plains, we are creating maps of projected bird distribution, given vegetation and land-use change under multiple future climate scenarios. Predictive bird distribution maps will help land managers and other decision-makers understand how their site-level projects fit within regional and climatic contexts. Training modules and a web-based application accompanying these maps will increase capacity among Federal, State, Tribal, and private partners in their conservation planning under a changing climate.\n\n\n\nSeek creation of an internship opportunity for a college student to work directly with research team (including staff from USGS, U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, and Oklahoma state University) to identify Tribal priorities for grassland bird management, help design training modules specific to Tribal professionals, and lead an independent study of Tribal lands using bird projection maps created from this research project. The intern also will have travel opportunities that may include field visits, in-person meetings with Tribal partners, and attending coproduction listening sessions and workshops. The intern will thereby gain experience in stakeholder engagement while developing modules, as well as research experience while leading an independent study.\"",

        "description": "\"This workshopThe study of degree d points on algebraic curves over   is a rich and mature area of research, with the Abel-Jacobi map and the Mordell-Lang conjecture providing powerful tools for exploration. However, for higher dimensional varieties there is no such approach that works in general. Because of this, we lack even a conjectural framework for understanding which higher dimensional varieties over   should have \"many\" degree d points.\n\n\n\nThe workshop will focus on questions aimed at addressing this dearth, concentrating on the case of algebraic surfaces. For instance, what does it mean for a surface over   to have \"many\" degree d points? What are some geometric constructions that give rise to abundant degree d points? Are these related to geometric measures of irrationality? If HilbdX has a Zariski dense set of  -points for some small d, does that yield any arithmetic or geometric consequences for X? If X embeds into its Albanese, can we obtain results analogous to that of curves?\n\n\n\nParticipants will be researchers from a broad array of backgrounds (e.g., arithmetic of surfaces, geometry of Hilbert schemes of surfaces, geometric measures of irrationality, arithmetic of 0-cycles, to name a few), ideally with a curiosity and interest in arithmetic questions.\n\n\n\nThis event will be run as an AIM-style workshop. Participants will be invited to suggest open problems and questions before the workshop begins, and these will be posted on the workshop website. These include specific problems on which there is hope of making some progress during the workshop, as well as more ambitious problems which may influence the future activity of the field. Lectures at the workshop will be focused on familiarizing the participants with the background material leading up to specific problems, and the schedule will include discussion and parallel working sessions.\"",

Currently we have several on-going projects to develop novel Raman spectrometers, Laser Inducted Breakdown (LIBS) spectrometers, laser delivery systems, collection optics and probeheads.\n\n\n\nWe are seeking Postdoctoral Scholars interested in participating in the development of an integrated Raman/LIBS spectrometer that can measure spectra at standoff distances ranging from several centimeters to several meters. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that LIBS/Raman spectra can be used to perform quantitative mineralogy and elemental analysis in extreme environments. One goal is to demonstrate quantitative mineralogy/elemental analysis of rocks samples held in a simulated Venus surface environment of 465?C and 93 bar. Another goal is to demonstrate that this technique is viable in very cold, high-pressure liquid environments that may be present beneath ice-covered oceans of Europa or Enceladus.\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral scholars are also sought to assist in the development of specialized ultraviolet Raman spectrometers designed to detect the resonant enhanced Raman spectra of conjugated or aromatic organic compounds representing signatures of life within Mars, Europa, Enceledus, Titan or other bodies in the solar system where life may exist. The successful candidate will be involved in the development of a multi-wavelength UV source as well as a UV Echelle Raman spectrometer enabling resonant Raman spectra of samples illuminated with multiple UV wavelengths to be processed simultaneously. Alternatively, Postdoctoral scholars may wish to explore the development of specialized probeheads utilizing metalized or liquid core optical waveguides to enhance sensitivity or utility of Raman, fluorescence, LIBS, or atomic absorption in-situ instruments.\n\n\n\nAll of the projects above are quite lab oriented. Candidates must have a strong interest in hands-on laboratory-based instrument development work. Candidates with expertise in lasers, optical instrument design, electronics, atomic emission spectroscopy, molecular spectroscopy, and chemometric techniques (PLS, nonlinear PLS, PLS-SVC, Kernel based methods, etc) are encouraged to apply.\n\n\n\n**Location:**  \n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory  \n\nPasadena, California  \n\n\n\n**Field of Science:** Planetary Science  \n\n\n\n**Advisors:**  \n\nJames L Lambert  \n\nJames.L.Lambert@jpl.nasa.gov  \n\n818-354-4181\"",

The aim of this fellowship is to produce new and original pieces of research that improve understanding of the role that China is playing in the Indo-Pacific, its relations with its neighbors and the United States, and its impact on peace and security issues. Additionally, the Fellowship seeks to build bridges between traditional academia and the policy world, and to support a new generation of American scholarship on China.\n\n\n\nPlease find the application guidelines on [our website](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/china-fellowship-application-guidelines) here, and the [online application here](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/china-fellowship-application-form).\n\n\n\n**Research Priorities**\n\nResearch projects supported by this Fellowship will:\n\n\n\n-    Focus on China's impact on political, social, economic, security, or historical issues and its impact on China s periphery, across Asia, and on China-U.S. relations.\n\n-    Develop concepts or explore topics that are understudied, unconventional, unique, emerging, or new within academic and policy discussions.\n\n-    Build upon historical and current research on U.S.-China relations and Chinese foreign policy.\n\n-    Combine academic rigor with policy relevance.\n\n-    Special consideration will be made for proposals that take an interdisciplinary approach.\n\n\n\nOur Wilson China Fellows include scholars and practitioners working on a diverse range of policy-relevant issue areas vital to understanding the rise of China and its implications for the United States and the world. They also represent the geographic breadth of American scholarship on China.\n\n\n\nRobert Daly, Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, said, \"Neither China's domestic development, nor U.S.-China relations, can be usefully evaluated outside the Indo-Pacific context. The Wilson China Fellowship will bring together young American scholars whose research will inform American policy throughout the region.\"\"",

        "description": "\"Notice Number: NOT-TR-20-011\nPurpose\n\n\n\nNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences ( NCATS ) is issuing this Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) to highlight the urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). NCATS is particularly interested in projects focusing on the use of informatics solutions to diagnose cases and the use of CTSA-supported core resources (e.g., advanced scientific instruments, highly-specialized facilities, and regulatory expertise) to facilitate research on COVID-19 and advance the translation of research findings into diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. NCATS is soliciting applications for Administrative Supplements to UL1, U01, and R21 awards (through PA-18-591 ), Collaborative Innovation Awards to U01 and R21 awards (through PAR-19-099 and PAR-19-100 , respectively), and Competitive Revisions for UL1 awards for each of the non-administrative supplement awards (through PAR-19-337 ).\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nTranslating biomedical discoveries into clinical applications is essential to improving human health. It is also a complex process with high costs and substantial failure rates. These failures can result in delays of years or decades before improved patient outcomes result from discoveries in biomedical research. Under NCATS' leadership, the CTSA Program supports a national consortium of medical research institutions that work together to tackle system-wide scientific and operational changes that solve the many outstanding problems limiting the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of clinical translational research, and thus get more treatments to more patients more quickly across the country. To do that, the program focuses on widely appreciated systematic barriers.\n\n\n\nCoronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses that cause a range of disease in humans and animals, and there are currently no approved coronavirus vaccines or therapeutics. In January 2020, a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified as the causative agent of an outbreak of viral pneumonia centered around Wuhan, China. Current information regarding confirmed cases is changing daily and can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html ) and through other sources. Transmission characteristics and the associated morbidity and mortality are not completely understood, but there is clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. Many other aspects of the disease are poorly understood. Given this, there is an urgent public health need to better understand the COVID-19.\"",

        "title": "\"Special Programme Forced Migration\"",
        "description": "\"Forced migration and the treatment of refugees and other displaced people currently find themselves at the center of many politicalWhile forced migration has been a subject of research in Anglo-Saxon scholarship since the 1980s, the attention paid thereto has recently seen significant increase in a number of specific European academic landscapes. African, Asian, Australian, and Latin American research has also seen a proliferation of such inquiries. Thus far, however, the approaches taken have been fragmented and there remain various thematic gaps, methodological deficits, and limited broader geographic connections. Hence there is a need to strengthen this core research and further expand the horizons of the interdisciplinary field of Forced Migration Studies going forward.\n\n\n\nFor the Gerda Henkel Foundation this marks an opportunity to commence its special programme on \"Forced migration\" and therewith build on the promising approaches and developments of global research but also respond to the existing desiderata in related scholarship. The special programme aims to support, in particular, internationally oriented, multidimensional research projects on forced migration that address questions receiving insufficient attention in the relevant debates thus far. This also involves further linking theoretical core research with concepts vital to social, humanitarian, and political praxis.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation welcomes research projects that adopt multidisciplinary approaches within this framework. Engaging in comparisons across regions and time periods should also be a priority here. Projects that incorporate intersectional perspectives and issues are highly desirable too. Depending on the research approach taken and possibilities at hand, cooperation with local knowledge-producers (researchers as well as civil society actors), or people affected by displacement within countries of origin or asylum (particularly in the  Global South ), is strongly encouraged.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation expects applicants to reflect on the ethical implications of their work, and also to develop plans to disseminate research results-including finding meaningful ways to address social, humanitarian, and/or political actors, as well as the nonspecialist public media and populace at large.\n\n\n\nThe special programme is aimed at researchers across a number of disciplines: Humanities, Social Sciences, Cultural Studies, Law, and Economics. Funding for research scholarships and for the implementation of research projects is offered. PhD scholarships are only granted in tandem with a specific research project.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation's Board of Trustees decides on the applications on the basis of recommendation by an International Advisory Committee.\n\n\n\nThe research projects should be linked to one or more of the following five core areas of research:\n\n\n\n**1) Forced-migration infrastructures**\n\n\n\nThe first thematic area places focus on examining conditions (e.g. actors, institutions, structures) that can encourage, restrain, or otherwise influence forced migration. Possible topics include analysis of the meanings of historical or present-day events and of decision-making processes culminating in leaving one's place of origin and undertaking journeys to certain specific destinations; the ways in which people take flight upon themselves; the routes and means of transport they use; how they acquire the necessary knowledge for planning and enactment; and, the roles networks or technological equipment play. Another subject of inquiry might be investigating what structures of assistance or care exist for and are created by displaced people in the process of flight and arrival, and how social dynamics among and between these individuals and host societies emerge and evolve.\n\n\n\n**2) South-South (im)mobilities**\n\n\n\nThe second thematic area places emphasis on research into motives, scopes, forms, and implications of mobilities and immobilities, or mobilizations and immobilizations, within and between southern states. Future studies could address, among other things, issues of rejection, reception, and integration vis-a-vis displaced people, as related to diverse actors; (im)mobilities at different moments in the displacement process, including prevented movements and involuntary immobilities; and, the roles of networks and relationships in intraregional arrival locations. Prospective scholarship could also tackle alternative, non-state integration structures such as the integration of displaced people in local communities, related motives, further to associated social, economic, cultural, and/or political mechanisms as well as consequences.\n\n\n\n**3) Multiple displacements**\n\n\n\nThe third thematic area goes beyond simplified understandings of monocausal, linear displacements from one place of origin to one place of asylum, approaching forced migration from a process-oriented perspective instead. This is because the conditions for forced migration not only frequently involve temporary stays in certain places, but there may also be nonpermanent temporary return migrations and recurring displacements. Possible studies could, for example, examine the motives behind and triggers of these dynamics as well as the displacement processes and underlying intentions of those affected. Questions of structural and physical insecurities, the effects of multiple displacements on social systems such as families, or developments and chains of recurrent adaptation are also worthy of further investigation.\n\n\n\n**4) Displaced people s agency**\n\n\n\nThe fourth thematic area concentrates on research into agency of the displaced. While those affected by forced migration are sometimes portrayed in humanitarian and political discourses as passive victims or even as threats to state security, displaced people s own perceptions and practices must receive adequate attention too. Possible studies could, for example, address the links between the vulnerabilities and agency of displaced people, examine the latter as political or legal subjects given their numerous individual and collective decision-making strategies and courses of action throughout the entire process of displacement, and explore motives and aspirations in movement as well as resilience.\n\n\n\n**5) (Supra-)state influences on displacement processes**\n\n\n\nThe fifth and final thematic area looks at the intimate connections between displacement and statehood. Even though eroded statehood often precedes displacement, it is by no means sufficient to focus primarily and exclusively on state dysfunction. Processes of forced migration are always influenced by state policies, be they repression, restrictive border regimes, or various forms of cooperation and confrontation between different states. Prospective projects could, for example, explore the role of nation-states and supranational organizations in causing, preventing, and shaping movements of the displaced. Here, scrutinizing indirect factors such as economic relations or clientelism, the influence of international, regional, and/or domestic law, or even the spatial dimension of mobility processes (\"scale\") would be extremely valuable.\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\n**Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.**\n\n\n\n**USFS Office/Lab and Location:** A research opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory located in Missoula, Montana.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the U.S. Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the U.S. Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\n\n\nLaboratory scientists work individually and collaboratively across research topics. Scientists often form multidisciplinary collaborative partnerships with experts from local, state, tribal, federal, international, academic, and non-governmental organizations. The scientist's research foci contribute to the work of other formal and informal teams both within the research program and those of other scientists inside and outside the agency.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** This opportunity is via Fire, Fuels, and Smoke (FFS) program at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory. The FFS program is active in local, regional, national, and international R&D activities. Program scientists accomplish the research mission through fundamental and applied research. Their research provides decision support tools for pre-fire planning, fire management, fire suppression, post fire analysis and prescribed burning. Many of the products from the unit have been adopted as the models or tools of choice by national and international land management organizations. The science and professional research staff include specialists in the physical sciences, engineering, chemistry, mathematics, meteorology, forestry, technology transfer, ecology, and spatial analysis.\n\n\n\nWe have an opportunity for a geospatial analyst to join a group investigating tradeoffs in prescribed fire smoke emissions in reducing future emissions from wildfires. Reducing carbon emissions is an area of concern given recent changes in climate. Prescribed fires produce emissions, but can reduce the intensity of future fires, which reduces future emissions. To fully explore this question requires a probabilistic modeling framework that takes into account the likelihood of future fires, their intensity, and how these translate into smoke emissions. Research into fire behavior and smoke emissions has been ongoing at the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory for decades. The participant may engage in a number of research activities to further understanding of tradeoffs in smoke emissions, including preparing inputs for, running, and analyzing the outputs of fire and vegetation simulation models, summarizing results in reports and publications, and preparing datasets for archiving and dissemination. To this end, the participant will engage with researchers and may engage with land managers including federal and Tribal partners. \n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:** The participant will further their skills in coding and geospatial analyses and learn skills in fire and vegetation simulation modeling, as well as management of large tabular and geospatial datasets. The participant will gain exposure to researchers at the Missoula Fire Sciences Lab and may present results at scientific conferences and workshops with land managers. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: June 2023;** start date is flexible (earlier or later).\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USFS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USFS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USFS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\"",

The RCNAF was established by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors to provide grants to eligible nonprofit agencies, specifically and in accordance with the Coronavirus State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, those that are 501 (c)(3) or 501 (c)(19) tax-exempt organizations, and which have suffered a negative financial impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic within Riverside County. The Fund was established to build on the County's efforts to strengthen, expand, and support the local nonprofit sector which has played a critical role in the pandemic response. This work was initiated with Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) funding in 2020-2021, in the form of small grants to support financial impacted nonprofits.

        "title": "\"Science and Technology Studies (STS) - Professional Development Grants\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: NSF 19-610\nSTS is an interdisciplinary field of research that uses historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods to investigate STEM theory and practice. It may focus on history and socio-cultural formation, philosophical underpinnings, or the impacts of science and technology on broader societal concerns including quality of life, ethics, and culture. STS researchers strive to understand the research assumptions of STEM fields, and the co-production of STEM and society, meaning the many ways in which cultural, economic, historical, social and political contexts influence developments in STEM, and how those developments reciprocally influence these contexts.\n\n\n\nSTS research encompasses a wide range of methods and disciplines. Some researchers rely on primary data collected during fieldwork or existing sources of secondary data, others use data from historical or governmental archives, while others develop conceptual or social analyses to answer theoretical or ethical questions. More generally, STS researchers draw on the resources and methods of a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, communication studies, economics, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. STS researchers come from a broad range of fields in addition to those already mentioned, including the natural and physical sciences, engineering, liberal arts and humanities. Recognized subfields of STS include social and cultural studies of science and technology, history and philosophy of science and technology, environmental history, and interdisciplinary studies of ethics, equity, and policy issues in the STEM fields. STS professional societies include the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S), the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), the History of Science Society (HSS), and the Philosophy of Science Association (PSA). Departments, centers, and programs that are primarily oriented towards STS research have a variety of names; the two most common names are \"Science and Technology Studies,\" and \"Science, Technology, and Society.\" Other names include \"History and Philosophy of Science and Technology,\" \"History and Sociology of Technology and Science,\" \"Science, Technology, and Values,\" and \"Science in Human Culture.\"\n\n\n\nSTS research focuses on the intellectual, material, and social facets of STEM. It endeavors to understand how scientific knowledge is produced and sanctioned, and how it is challenged and changes. It may examine the theoretical foundations of science, bring to light underlying presuppositions and alternative interpretations, or study the reliability of research methods. STS research also studies how materials, devices, and techniques are designed and developed; how and by whom they are diffused, used, adapted, and rejected; how they are affected by social and cultural environments; and how they influence quality of life, culture, and society. It also explores how socio-cultural values are embedded in science and technology, and how issues of governance and equity co-evolve with the development and use of scientific knowledge and technological artifacts. Finally, it may provide insights into the relationship between STEM and basic categories of social thought including race and gender, poverty and development, trust and credibility, participation and democracy, health and pathology, risk and uncertainty, globalization, and environmental concerns.\n\n\n\nThe STS program supports proposals across the broad spectrum of STS research areas, topics, and approaches. They include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n1.    Studies of societal aspects of an emerging technology such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, neuroscience, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and quantum technologies (computers, sensors, and encryption).\n\n2.    Research on the social organization of scientific work (e.g., organizations, groups, and collaborations) and how this shapes the knowledge that gets produced and its intellectual and social impacts.\n\n3.    Issues relating science and engineering to broader societal concerns including ethics, policy, governance, equity, race and gender, inclusion, trust, reliability, risk and uncertainty, sustainability, user-centeredness, and globalization.\n\n4.    Research on the historical and conceptual foundations of any of the natural, social, or formal sciences including its nature and fundamentals, its origins, or its place in modern politics, culture, and society.\n\n5.    Mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) approaches, and approaches that integrate traditional STS perspectives (historical, philosophical, social scientific) with each other or with innovative perspectives from the arts or humanities.\n\n6.    Interdisciplinary projects on topics of broad societal concern that engage in integrative collaborative research involving at least one STS expert and one in some other STEM field with prospective outcomes that serve to advance both fields.\n\n\n\nTypes of Proposals\n\n\n\nThe STS program supports several distinct types of proposals in order to accommodate the diverse research needs of the STS community. Types of proposals include Standard Research Grants and Grants for Collaborative Research, Scholars Awards, Conference Support, and Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants.\n\n\n\nTo assist the program in reviewing the same types of proposals together, you must include a prefix in the title of the proposal that indicates the type of proposal being requested; for example, if the conference title is \"On the Reliability of Evidence in Forensic Science,\" the conference proposal title should be \"Conference: On the Reliability of Evidence in Forensic Science.\"\n\n\n\n**3. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS**\n\n\n\nThe STS program supports specialized methodological training for post-PhD researchers in STS who have active research programs that would be enhanced by such training. The goal of the program is to improve STS research skills by affording researchers the opportunity to undertake training not normally available on their home campuses. Support may be requested to learn any methodological skill that will advance their research agenda, as justified in the proposal with reference to results from prior work.\n\n\n\nPlease note that these are training awards, not research awards. The proposal must include a detailed study plan that indicates sponsorship by a senior expert (who should not have been involved with the proposer's Ph.D.) with whom the proposer will study and/or who will supervise the planned program of study. A signed statement affirming sponsorship must be included in the proposal (as a Supplementary Document). Proposals should show how this additional expertise would improve the proposer's ability to do research by referring to specific ongoing research projects and publications. Requests for support of a general upgrading of quantitative or methodological skills, for coursework routinely available on university campuses, or for language training, will not be successful. Professional Development Grant proposals should be submitted in accordance with the PAPPG requirements.\n\n\n\nBudget Guidelines for Professional Development Grants Proposals\n\n\n\nProfessional Development Grants have a ceiling of $75,000 and a maximum duration of 36 months. They may include requests for summer salary, academic year release time, per diem, travel, equipment, supplies, and other training expenses, as well as applicable indirect costs.\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\n**Research Topic Description, including Problem Statement:**\n\n\n\nThe supply chain for the components used to produce genuine identity documents is not closed unlike others such as currency. This can leave items in the production process able to be acquired by unauthorized entities. Nearly exact materials, or reasonable simulations are widely available from hundreds of public marketplaces and websites. This is problematic, as counterfeiters have access to materials needed to produce documents that closely mimic genuine versions. But this scenario introduces detectable variations in the materials being utilized and creates an opportunity for research.\n\n\n\nDHS seeks to expand the ability to link counterfeit documents to include non-destructive and destructive analysis of counterfeit identification documents, publicly available materials, as well as genuine documents. Similar to longstanding approaches to identify geographic sources for illicit drugs, the data from this analysis will allow the association of items and will increase the DHS's ability to trace the origin of counterfeit items, which is expected to improve the detection, disruption and deterrence of identity document counterfeiting or alteration.\n\n\n\nAmong other forensic and intelligence functions, the forensic assessment of domestic and international travel and identity documents is the purview of the Homeland Security Investigations Forensic Lab (within DHS). The Forensic Lab is the only ANAB (ANSI National Accreditation Board)-accredited laboratory in the US tasked with forensic examinations of international travel and identity documents. In support of those forensic examinations, the lab is staffed by bench forensic examiners, as well as physical scientists, and has a variety of scientific equipment.\n\n\n\nThe selected methods for analysis should be restricted to instrumentation in use at the HSI laboratory, including X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Micro-XRF); SEM/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS); Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR); Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GCMS); Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma MS (LA-ICP/MS); Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). \n\n\n\nIt is expected that data resulting from this research will be appropriate for journal publication or presentation at a professional meeting.\n\n\n\n**Example Approaches:**\n\n\n\nIdentify a common component that is used across a diversity of counterfeit documents and can be traced to a specific manufacturer, distributor. Develop understanding of certain characteristics that indicate common equipment was used to produce different counterfeit document templates.\n\n\n\n**Relevance to the Intelligence Community:**\n\n\n\nDevelop/enhance remote retrieval of biometric, identity, signatures, geospatial, and other data across multiple settings.\n\n\n\n**Key Words:** identity, counterfeit, passport, driver's license, document personalization, secure documents, supply chain, logistics, forensics analysis\"",

This is a BAA of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This acquisition is unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of this solicitation. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology), and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.\n\n\n\nb. AFRL/RW awards to educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Air Delivered Effects. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest under this Directorate. Offerors contemplating a submission to AFRL/RW are strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/RW technical POC for the research area to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.\n\n\n\nc. AFRL/RW is the primary Department of the Air Force (DAF) organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Weapons Program Offices. There are three product divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&D). They are the Ordnance Division (RWM), Weapon Engagement Sciences Division (RWW), and Strategic Planning and Integration Division (RWP).\n\n\n\n**RESEARCH AREA 17 - WEAPONS AUTONOMY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWWN)**\n\n\n\nRWWN is interested in novel hardware, software, and algorithms to support and enable autonomous weapon concepts and capabilities especially in highly contested environments.\n\n\n\nNovel bio-inspired sensing and wide-field-of-view seeker hardware are desired to create improved situational awareness as well as improved integrated sensing-control algorithms. Test and evaluation hardware and scene generation technology are also desired for distributed aperture and wide-field sensing. Limited communication in contested environments might require decentralized, high-level cognitive functions: technologies that enable context-aware reasoning, multi-agent coordination, graceful performance degradation, and inherently flexible or reconfigurable operation are highly desired. Unified architectures or mathematical languages applicable to the control and coordination of heterogeneous information services and that enable verifiable, trusted autonomy are also sought. Network-aware capabilities, especially technology that cognitively matches machines with human oversight, would enable trusted cooperation and increased capacity for autonomous weapon deployment. Finally, science and technology that allows for fractionated weapon performance (having capability spread across multiple assets that coordinate to deliver a desired effect) and composable functions (where disparate capabilities can be combined synergistically to create multiple desired effects) are also of interest.\"",

        "description": " A jump into Precision Medicine.\"**Purpose**  \n\n\n\n***Background:***\n\n\n\nVariable responses to ART are due at least in part to human genetic variants that affect drug metabolism, drug disposition, and off-site drug targets. Defining effects of human genetic variants on HIV treatment toxicity, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics has far-reaching implications. Substances of abuse (opioid, stimulants, nicotine, anxiolytics, alcohol, etc.) and its treatments (methadone, buprenorphine, extended naltrexone, etc.) may interact with ART, altering its bioavailability, its safety, and its efficacy. It is known that nevirapine and efavirenz increase methadone clearance. New evidence demonstrates that variabilities in responses to ART depend in part on genetic variants for certain drugs of abuse and its therapies. For instance, a NR1I3 gene variant affected methadone clearance only in those taking efavirenz. Two other genetic variants in the *ABCB1* and *CYP2B6* genes decreased methadone clearance. More research, though, is necessary to better understand the role of pharmacogenomics in people with HIV (PLWH) with substance use disorders (SUD).\n\n\n\n*Research Areas*\n\n\n\n*NIDA is interested in receiving research proposals focusing on studying **pharmacogenomics** in PLWH with SUD as a crucial step in the science of Precision Medicine, in the path of personalized care for HIV and drug abuse..*\n\n\n\n***Topics include but are not limited to:***\n\n\n\n-  *Correlation of genomics with ART, drugs of abuse and its treatments with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME)*\n\n-  *Population differences in genotypic frequencies*\n\n-  *Multiple genetic variants and its consequences*\n\n-  *Clinical phenotypes and its pharmacogenomic correlations*\n\n-  *Genomic-wide association studies (GWAS)*\n\n-  *Medical consequences of pharmacogenomic interactions with SUD-safety and efficacy*\n\n-  *Phenotypic and genomic at-risk populations; twin studies*\n\n-  *Geographical correlations (rural, islands, international); areas of wide (e.g., Africa) vs limited (e.g., Iceland) genetic diversity*\n\n-  *Informatics*\n\n-  *Study design and methodology (e.g., prospective targeted vs observational), cost-effectiveness*\"",

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** CDC-RFA-TP22-2201  \nCDC seeks to enhance the nation's ability to rapidly mobilize, surge, and respond to public health emergencies (PHEs) as identified by CDC by establishing a roster of approved but unfunded (ABU) applicants that may receive rapid funding to respond to PHEs of such magnitude, complexity, or significance that they would have an overwhelming impact upon, and exceed resources available to, the jurisdictions. Applicants will undergo an objective merit review process, and entities that successfully meet the requirements for approval will be placed on the ABU list. CDC will use this ABU list for emergencies that require federal support to effectively respond to, manage, and address identified public health threats. CDC will make funding related to this NOFO available once it has determined a public health emergency exists or is considered imminent and will be contingent upon the availability and stipulations of appropriations. CDC will provide additional guidance and information to those on the ABU list when this NOFO is funded. Since this NOFO is designed to collect applications prior to a PHE, applicants are encouraged to submit work plans and budgets that demonstrate their ability to respond to a PHE. COVID-19 public health response plans, such as plans funded under CDC-RFA-TP18-1802 in 2020 are acceptable for this purpose. If this NOFO is funded for a specific PHE, CDC will develop supplemental guidance that outlines additional work plan and budget requirements tailored to the emergency. This NOFO is not a capacity-building funding mechanism, and it is not intended to create or establish new public health (PH) emergency management programs. It may be used to re- establish capacity lost or diminished because of the public health crisis. It is designed to support the surge needs of existing programs responding to a significant PHE. CDC will provide supplemental guidance to entities on the ABU list when this NOFO is activated regarding specific activities intended to address the emergency. CDC has strong relationships with governmental PH departments, community-based organizations, and other domestic partners and supports them for planning, capacity-building, preparedness, and response to PHEs. This NOFO complements these ongoing capacity-building preparedness and response programs by providing a mechanism for CDC to rapidly mobilize and fund PH organizations for specific response needs. Applicants must describe how this funding will not duplicate or supplant other federal funding. Upon occurrence of a PHE, CDC can rapidly fund specific applicants to accelerate public health crisis response activities such as coordinating emergency operations, hiring surge staff, and conducting needs assessments to determine the resources necessary to address the public health crisis. The NOFO also provides funding for specialized public health emergency response activities tailored to the specific public health crisis.\"",

These funds are intended to enhance ongoing research by enabling NIDCR-funded researchers to form a new collaboration that was not anticipated at the time of submission, review, and funding of the parent award. There must be sufficient progress on the parent project to justify the additional supplemental work. These collaborative activities must be within the scope of the approved aims of the parent award and are expected to generate important new opportunities for achieving the goals of the parent project and benefiting the research program of the collaborator.\n\n\n\nCollaborations must be newly-established, that is, there must not be a substantial history of collaboration within the past three years between the grantee Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) and the collaborator (e.g., there must not be coauthored publications nor any NIH awards that have been funded with the proposed collaborator within the past three years). The leader of the collaborating group should hold the equivalent of an independent faculty appointment in academia or serve as a group leader in industry, and must provide evidence of active engagement in research, such as grant support. Collaborations that bring together ideas, theories, methods, and approaches from different scientific and clinical disciplines are particularly encouraged.\n\n\n\nTypes of collaborative science encouraged through this Notice include new collaborations that encompass but are not limited to:\n\n- Early Stage Investigators (ESIs)\n\n- Individuals from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences\n\n- Scientists in a different scientific or clinical discipline\n\n- Scientists new to dental, oral, and craniofacial research areas\n\n- Scientists in industry or small businesses\n\n\n\nCollaborative activities should not include solely the provision of reagents and materials but rather are expected to involve integration and exchange of ideas, knowledge, data, and methodologies to contribute to the parent project. Partnering with investigators to access state-of-the-art methodology or data generation and analysis methodologies that fall within the purpose of this collaborative supplement are allowed. Additional salary support for the PD/PI in the supplement application is discouraged.\n\n\n\nPD/PIs are strongly encouraged to contact the Program Official named in the Notice of Grant Award to discuss the collaborative project in relation to the parent project prior to submitting an application for this administrative supplement. Collaborations with non-domestic (non-U.S.) entities (foreign institutions) are eligible. Grantee organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is distinct from other administrative supplements or other types of grant applications already funded or under consideration by the awarding NIH Institute or Center; however, each grant is limited to one application for an administrative supplement for collaborative science.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: SFOP0009272  \nThe U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) announces an open competition for organizations interested in submitting applications for projects that support religious freedom in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nApplicants will be responsible for ensuring program activities and products are implemented in accordance with the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\nDRL's goal is to reduce religious intolerance and generate conditions for peace between religious and belief communities in Nigeria s North and North Central states by empowering youth leaders from diverse religious and belief communities. As cited in the 2021 IRF Report, NGOs, civil society organizations, and media recognize an increased level of insecurity and violence across Nigeria with exacerbated tensions and mistrust among religious groups as being \"the primary pathway to intercommunal conflict in the North.\" Insecurity linked to issues of religion, belief, and identity remains pervasive throughout the country. Intolerance of diverse beliefs has also fueled mob violence and distrust of minority religious or belief communities.\n\nEthnicity, land and resource competition, criminality, and lack of accountability and access to justice also fuel sustained tensions.\n\n\n\nYoung Nigerians will be equipped with peacebuilding and conflict mitigation skills, empowering them to lead community initiatives that build respect and tolerance among religious and belief communities. This program seeks to mitigate the impact that religious tensions have on communal distrust by 1) increasing awareness of the ways in which discrimination and intolerance fuel violence and 2) building mechanisms to help resolve conflict and prevent violence. Programs should include youth participation in the design and implementation of all program activities. For the purposes of this program, youth shall be from ages 18-24.\n\n\n\nExpected program outcomes may include but are not limited to:\n\n-      Youth leaders increase awareness of the value and importance of religious pluralism with mutual respect and inclusion for all among their communities;\n\n-      Youth leaders form processes or mechanisms that encourage dialogue to address the interests of members from all religions and beliefs;\n\n-      Multifaith engagement and dialogue led by youth leaders provides an opportunity for advocacy coordination and collective action around shared concerns;\n\n-      Youth leaders advocate for the rights of individuals of all religions or beliefs;\n\n-      Youth leaders and community actors take collective action to promote and protect the freedoms of members of all religions and beliefs.\n\nProgram activities may include but are not limited to:\n\n-      Educating youth leaders from diverse faith and ethnic communities to counter stereotypes and discriminatory beliefs and practices;\n\n-      Educating youth leaders on the mutually reinforcing rights to freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression and as legally protected in Nigeria and under international law;\n\n-      Building capacity of youth to engage in advocacy to support religious tolerance and decrease tension and discrimination between faith and ethnic communities.\n\n-    Capacity building activities may include but are not limited to improving conflict resolution and peacebuilding skills, communication skills, coalition building skills, dialogue, advocacy, and public engagement skills.\n\n-      Creating youth leadership opportunities through training and small grants to promote leadership, peaceful coexistence, and cooperation across communities;\n\n-      Expanding or creating opportunities for dialogue and joint action between and among youth and between youth and community influencers and policy makers to advocate for community peacebuilding and respect for individuals with differing beliefs. These advocacy activities can include but are not limited to public fora, town halls, journalism, public outreach/education, media campaigns, small grants, and other work;\n\n-      Developing a strategic engagement framework for ongoing efforts inclusive but not limited to dialogue, advocacy, social engagement, and community focused projects.\n\n\n\nAll programs should aim to have impact that leads to reforms and should have the potential for sustainability beyond DRL resources.  DRL s preference is to avoid duplicating past efforts by supporting new and creative approaches.  This does not exclude from consideration projects that improve upon or expand existing successful projects in a new and complementary way.  DRL is committed to advancing equity and support for underserved and underrepresented communities.\n\n\n\nPrograms should seek strategies for integration and inclusion of individuals/organizations/beneficiaries that can bring perspectives based on their religion, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sex characteristics, national origin, age, genetic information, marital status, parental status, pregnancy, political affiliation, or veteran s status.  Programs should be demand-driven and locally led to the extent possible.

        "description": " ADHD\"Center for Truth in Science\n\n\n\n****Title****\n\n\n\nThe Center for Truth in Science is requesting applications from qualified researchers to perform an independent systematic review of the literature used in assessing the relationship between the use of acetaminophen (paracetamol, N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol, APAP) during pregnancy and the risk of neurodevelopment disorders in the exposed child, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\n\n\n****Action****\n\n\n\nRequest for applications from qualified researchers\n\n\n\n****Summary****\n\n\n\nThis notice solicits applications from eligible entities to compete for a financial grant from the Center for Truth in Science (\"the Center\") to conduct a systematic review of the literature used in assessing the relationship between the use of acetaminophen (paracetamol, N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol, APAP) during pregnancy and the risk of neurodevelopment disorders in the exposed child, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this work is to assess the strength and quality of the research to date, and to reach conclusions about what is known regarding any increased risk from the highest quality studies, the strength of any associations found, as well as to identify and inform future directions for research, as may be needed. \n\n\n\n****Objectives****\n\n\n\n1.  Determine the extent to which scientific evidence demonstrates a clear causal link between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen at different doses, and neurodevelopment disorders. This should include any synergistic or antagonistic factors.\n\n2.  Apply accepted state-of-the-art systematic review methods to determine what conclusions can be scientifically drawn and supported from the highest quality existing studies, including (where systematic bias is evaluated) the consideration and evaluation of any systematic bias and its direction and estimated magnitude.\n\n3.  Determine reasons for conflicting or contradictory findings among existing studies, with special emphasis on identified confounders.\n\n4.  Develop recommendations for additional research that can improve the accuracy and reliability of findings in this area.\n\n\n\n****Background Information****\n\n\n\nThe use of acetaminophen in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy has been reported by 69.9% of U.S. women.[\\[1\\]](https://truthinscience.org/about/grants-careers/request-for-research-proposals-systematic-review-of-research-on-acetaminophen-and-asd-adhd#_ftn1) It is likely that more than 50% of women worldwide use acetaminophen during pregnancy. Most maternal care experts recommend it as a safe method to treat pain and fever in pregnant women when used in the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, concerns have arisen that exposure to acetaminophen in the womb could lead to neurodevelopment disorders in children, including ADHD and ASD. In September 2021, a group of scientists issued what they named a  **Consensus Statement**  on the use of the pain reliever and fever reducer acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nThe statement, which was published in *Nature Reviews Endocrinology*, has been supported by 91 scientists, clinicians, and public health professionals. It states:\n\n\n\n*A growing body of experimental and epidemiological research suggests that prenatal exposure to paracetamol (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), otherwise known as acetaminophen) might alter fetal development, which could in turn increase the risks of certain neurodevelopmental reproductive and urogenital disorders \\[including Autism Spectrum Disorders and ADHD\\].[**\\[2\\]**](https://truthinscience.org/about/grants-careers/request-for-research-proposals-systematic-review-of-research-on-acetaminophen-and-asd-adhd#_ftn2)*\n\n\n\nThree subsequent rebuttals, also published in *Nature Reviews Endocrinology*, raised many questions about the science that was used in the rationale underlying the Consensus Statement. These questions address the quality of the studies used, the lack of mechanistic data, and several other issues. The 13 scientists who composed the first rebuttal expressed the following concerns and reasons for concern[\\[3\\]](https://truthinscience.org/about/grants-careers/request-for-research-proposals-systematic-review-of-research-on-acetaminophen-and-asd-adhd#_ftn3):\n\n\n\n-   The Consensus Statement makes clinical conclusions using data from which causality cannot be clearly inferred.\n\n-   Many of the studies referenced in the Consensus Statement use unvalidated outcome measurements, for example, parent- or teacher-filled questionnaires on Likert scales that were not created or validated for the purpose and context in which they were used.\n\n-   The authors felt the Consensus Statement fails to account for a significant potential confounder: the hereditary aspects of ASD, neurodevelopment, and ADHD.\n\n-   The Consensus Statement appears to the rebuttal authors to favor studies that confirm the preexisting beliefs of the authors, regardless of the quality of the evidence. They give as an example, the uncritical appraisal of a study from the Boston Birth Cohort which was given a great deal of weight by the Statement authors to determine acetaminophen exposure using umbilical cord plasma concentrations, and then correlating exposure levels with childhood ADHD, ASD, and other neurodevelopment diagnoses. In contrast, the rebuttal authors indicate the external and internal validity of this study were likely compromised-acetaminophen or its metabolites were found in every single one of the umbilical cord samples. In addition, the rebuttal authors point out a surprisingly large proportion of the study children were diagnosed with ADHD or ASD (37%). Only 33% had no  developmental disability  diagnoses.\n\n\n\nThe second rebuttal, offered by 50 scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, and specialists who are affiliated with the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists and other partner groups, completed their own review of the literature and concluded the following[\\[4\\]](https://truthinscience.org/about/grants-careers/request-for-research-proposals-systematic-review-of-research-on-acetaminophen-and-asd-adhd#_ftn4):\n\n\n\n-   The authors of this rebuttal believe that the studies used in the Consensus Statement are limited by serious methodological problems, such as potential differential exposure and misclassification of the timing, dose, and duration of the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, as well as possible confusion with other pain relief medications, which could lead to an overestimation of the true effect.\n\n-   The rebuttal authors also felt the Consensus Statement fails to account for a potential confounder: Pregnant women also use acetaminophen to treat migraines or fever, both of which themselves have been associated with adverse effects on fetal neurological development.\n\n-   The rebuttal authors also pointed out that the Consensus Statement does not consider the potential for genetic susceptibility to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions passed from parent to child.\n\n\n\nAnd the third rebuttal, signed by 16 organizations and 63 individual researchers and clinicians, added the following insights[\\[5\\]](https://truthinscience.org/about/grants-careers/request-for-research-proposals-systematic-review-of-research-on-acetaminophen-and-asd-adhd#_ftn5):\n\n\n\n-   There is a tendency in the Consensus Statement to make direct fetal risks the priority and to overlook other risks, especially to mothers.\n\n-   The rebuttal also noted the Consensus Statement claims 65% of pregnant women report taking acetaminophen, but fails to define what they consider as typical use. The Statement admits that timing and duration are likely essential factors with evidence suggesting that exposure for more than two weeks in the late first or second trimester might be important. The rebuttal authors cite a 2020 survey which reported that half of women taking acetaminophen in pregnancy only do so for less than three days.\n\n-   In addition, that survey reports on the dangers of established medications which might create problems in accepting new therapies, including vaccines, potentially increasing hesitancy during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nMany high-level groups in the U.S. continue to support the safety of acetaminophen when used as directed, including the Food and Drug Administration, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society for Maternal and Fetal Medicine, and the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists.\n\n\n\nFrom the original Consensus Statement published in 2021, through the three published rebuttals, there are differences in how the research has been reviewed and interpreted. All of the above were developed by knowledgeable experts in the field. This necessitates the conduct of a state-of-the-science systematic review as outlined below.\"",

        "title": "\"Workshops on Computational and Analytical Research Methods (R25 - Clinical Trial Not Allowed)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-DA-23-027  \nThe NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the NIH Institutes and Centers. \n\n\n\nThe overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation's biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs.\n\n\n\nThe NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research education activities in the mission areas of the NIH. The overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation's biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this FOA will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:\n\n\n\n-  **Courses for Skills Development:** Activities may include short-term workshops or seminars for undergraduate, graduate/medical students, postdoctorates, medical residents, and faculty that will emphasize computational and analytical research methods. Particular topics of interest include biostatistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and explanatory modeling, enhanced rigor and reproducibility in big data analyses.\n\n\n\nResearch education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving Federal support. R25 programs may augment institutional research training programs (e.g., T32, T90) but cannot be used to replace or circumvent Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) programs.\n\n\n\n****Background:****\n\n\n\nNeurocognitive studies have undergone transformative changes over the last decade. The first change has been a shift in the field towards pooling together smaller datasets (e.g., ENIGMA) or creating larger ones that are widely disseminated (e.g., Human Connectome Project, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, the Healthy Brain and Cognitive Development Study, the All of Us Research Program). This shift has accelerated artificial intelligence-based efforts towards prediction of substance use and psychiatric outcomes. Increased access to large-scale, open data has led to a large number of analyses being conducted on such data, and subsequently to a significant number of false positives being reported. Further, because of the large sample sizes, there is a high likelihood that analyses will produce statistically significant effects with small effect sizes that may not be clinically or biologically meaningful. Thus, the nature of the study requires extraordinary caution in conducting analyses and interpreting results. *Responsible use of large and complex datasets therefore requires knowledge of analytical and statistical considerations specific to large datasets.* Researchers will also need to be familiar with existing large-scale analysis tools, and/or learn to develop new ones.\n\n\n\nThe second shift comes from significant advances in explanatory modeling that seek to uncover neural computational mechanisms underlying cognition, behavior, and associated dysfunction (e.g., reinforcement learning models applied towards dopamine's role in reward learning and motivation). *While major advancements have been made in the development of rigorous analytical and computational methods, their application in substance use disorders (SUD) research remains an area for further growth.* Computational psychiatry combines multiple types of computation with experimental data towards improving understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. These approaches show immense potential for uncovering complex mechanisms underlying SUD. For example, computational models using reinforcement learning models, Bayesian models, and other approaches have begun to dissect neurocognitive domains pertinent to SUD, such as reward learning and cognitive control, and are being used to develop translational models in both humans and animals. Further, such models make underlying scientific assumptions more explicit and generate quantitative predictions that can be tested experimentally, which will be important to enhance rigor and reproducibility in the field.\n\n\n\n****Objectives****\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this FOA is to invite applications that involve training on computational and analytical research methods, including on topics such as biostatistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and mechanistic modeling specific to mission of NIDA. Training is expected to be conducted through meetings/workshops involving advanced seminars relevant to computational and analytical analyses combined with hands-on training.\n\n\n\nThe overall goals of this initiative are:\n\n\n\n-  Facilitating collaboration between clinical and computational researchers on substance use and SUD research\n\n-  Enhancing rigor and reproducibility towards better predictive models\n\n-  Broader application of sophisticated analytical and computational modeling approaches in substance use and SUD research\n\n-  Development of novel solutions to challenges faced in clinical application of computational psychiatry models\n\n\n\nNIDA is particularly interested in supporting workshops and related activities in the following areas:\n\n\n\n*Hypothesis Testing*\n\n\n\nNIDA will support applications emphasizing hypothesis testing related to SUD using the\n\n\n\nAdolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\n\n\n\n(ABCD) dataset. This includes, but is not limited to, applications addressing the following:\n\n\n\n-  Development of models predicting substance use and SUD\n\n-  Development of models predicting behavior related to SUD, such as impulsivity, externalizing behaviors, reward and punishment learning, risk-taking, cognitive control\n\n-  Development of models predicting brain measures related to SUD, such as frontostriatal dysfunction, interaction between large scale networks (e.g., default mode network, executive control network, salience network), insula function\n\n-  Development of models predicting or explaining fundamental neural circuitry, cognition, and behavior relevant to substance use and SUD\n\n-  Identification of population subtypes that relate to substance use outcomes\n\n-  Investigation of socioenvironmental variables predictive of SUD trajectories\n\n-  Responsible use of open-access population data\n\n\n\n*Technology Development*\n\n\n\nNIDA is also interested in applications emphasizing training on the development of analytic tools and technology towards enhancing predictive modeling from large datasets. This includes, but is not limited to, applications addressing the following:\n\n\n\n-  Development of tools for optimization of existing analysis tools for large datasets\n\n-  Development of cloud-based tools for big data analysis and visualization\n\n-  Development of best practices for computational and analytical approaches towards substance use data\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: W81EWF-23-SOI-0023  \nMicrobially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a form of biomediated geotechnical soil improvement that has been proposed to enhance the strength and hydraulic conductivity characteristics of soils and has been considered for a range of geotechnical applications (DeJong et al. 2006; 2014; 2022). MICP enhances geotechnical properties through the bacterial precipitation of calcite, which can act as a binding agent between particles in a soil mass. Although lab and field scale research has increasingly shown potential positive impact on engineering properties and applications, little is known about the interaction of an MICP-treated soil mass with vegetation and vegetative regrowth, which are important aspects for usability and sustainability of soil improvement techniques on many flood control infrastructure projects. Prior research has shown that MICP treated soils exhibited seedling growth but heavily treated MICP soils exhibited sparse vegetation growth (Ghasemi & Montoya, 2022). These findings suggest that a balance is needed between the biomediation to increase engineering properties and the concentration of MICP that inhibits vegetation growth. Understanding this balance is important for informing the potential for MICP implementation, particularly in light of the increasing importance of nature-based engineering solutions and ensuring that engineered infrastructure is nature-inclusive.\"",

That is why Cal State University Dominguez Hills and I appreciate Mayor Rex Richardson, a proud alumnus of our institution, and are honored to participate in this occasion to connect our students with paid workforce readiness experience while in school, as part of the public service corps program in the City of Long Beach. \n\n\n\n Long Beach City College is excited to be part of the Long Beach Public Service Corps. This is a great opportunity to enrich our students' academic experience with invaluable work experience through the City of Long Beach,  said Dr. Mike Munoz, Long Beach City College Superintendent-President.  By participating in the Public Service Corps, our students will become more knowledgeable members of the community, make a positive impact on the City of Long Beach, and gain a deeper understanding of how to make a career in public service. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the paid fellowship, throughout the program, participants will engage in a series of professional development workshops designed to highlight important topics in public service, such as budgeting, community engagement, crisis management, sustainability, ethics, and policy. Participants will also complete project-based learning activities with the Long Beach Health and Human Services Department's Office of Youth Development that will inform the planning of the City s Youth Festival in 2024 and Youth Week in 2025.\n\n\n\nThe Long Beach Public Service Corps is a collaborative effort between the City s Department of Economic Development s Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network, Department of Human Resources, and legislative offices and support staff. Pacific Gateway will oversee management of the program on behalf of the City, including case management and payroll coordination, and supportive wraparound services such as transportation assistance, clothing vouchers, rental assistance, and utility payment assistance, to ensure participants have the flexibility and a foundation of support to participate in the program successfully. Participants will also receive follow-up services such as job counseling, employment placement, and access to industry-recognized training to support their long-term career goals.\n\n\n\nThe City has collaborated with educational stakeholders, including deans of public administration programs, college and career center staff, workforce development executives, and Long Beach College Promise program staff, to promote this program to eligible students and encourage participation. Two virtual information sessions were also held for those interested in learning more about the program.\n\n\n\n We are excited about this opportunity to partner and collaborate with various City departments and colleges for the Long Beach Public Service Corps program,  said Pacific Gateways Acting Executive Director, Alisa Munoz.  Pacific Gateway has extensive experience delivering training programs and looks forward to providing residents with the services and skills that will pave the way for a career in public service. \n\n\n\nAligning with Mayor Richardson s priority to establish a Public Service Pathways Program as discussed during his first 100-days in office and at the 2023 State of the City, the City Manager proposed a one-time allocation of $300,000 in the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 24) budget which was approved by the full City Council on Sept. 5, 2023. This one-time funding to the Economic Development Department s Workforce Development Bureau, operating as Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network (Pacific Gateway), supports the design and implementation of the Long Beach Public Service Corps.\"",

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** DFOP0016574  \nThe overall goal of ProCON Global is to promote open, interoperable, reliable, and secure commercial undersea cable systems around the world. The project will provide technical assistance to key decision-makers, including policymakers, regulators, and technology companies in emerging economies, to promote evaluation processes and investment in secure and trusted vendors when establishing undersea cable network supply chains. Technology companies include telecommunications operators/carriers, major technology and security firms, innovators, and content and cloud providers.\n\n\n\nThe ProCON Global project will provide targeted regional and national-level technical advisory support to raise awareness of the security risks and quality/reliability issues with using untrusted vendors to build and maintain undersea cables globally.  The project will also address the importance of redundancy and resiliency of undersea cables landing infrastructure. ProCON Global will highlight the market ramifications of choosing untrusted vendors, including the significant commercial limitations purchasers will face in monetizing system capacity, when doing business with vendors headquartered in countries with weak rule of law.  ProCON Global will identify trusted vendors for procurement of equipment and identify service opportunities associated with undersea cable deployment, operation, and maintenance.  ProCON Global will provide partner government officials, industry actors, and other stakeholders with advisory support to develop undersea cables strategies, consider undersea cables as critical infrastructure, and develop policies and laws on undersea cables.  ProCON Global will also provide technical assistance to improve the business and regulatory environments for undersea cables across their lifecycle.\n\n\n\nThis technical assistance will promote the use of trusted vendors for installation and maintenance of undersea cable systems, intergovernmental and commercial alliances, and diplomacy for the promotion of undersea cable routes and access that reduces overall risk.  ProCON Global seeks to ensure the continued expansion of world-wide connectivity and broadband through the development of new undersea cables and ensuring that operations, repair, and maintenance of existing cables are conducted by trusted vendors.   The ProCON Global implementer will conduct an overview of current, planned, and anticipated global undersea cables to inform the Department's ongoing policies, engagements, and strategic programming direction for foreign assistance. ProCON Global will also provide current and projected country-based analysis on all aspects of undersea cables, including the use (and/or anticipated) trusted or untrusted vendors for operations and maintenance activities. This analysis will inform foreign beneficiaries and key stakeholders of connectivity opportunities and potential partnerships to maximize access to secure and trusted ICT ecosystems.  Additionally, these activities should equip policymakers, regulators, and private sector stakeholders to make informed policy decisions against the security risks, vulnerabilities, quality, and reliability issues associated with using untrusted vendors for commercial undersea cable systems.\n\n\n\nIn support of expanding secure and trusted undersea connectivity efforts, this project will include a workstream via sub-awards dedicated to a ProCON Global capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) incubator to support existing private sector infrastructure efforts to expand undersea connectivity and associated ecosystems.\n\n\n\n**Project Goals, Objectives, Expected Outcomes, Activities, Indicators, and Sustainability**\n\n\n\nProCON Global will promote the use of trusted vendors for installation and maintenance or repair of undersea cable systems, the use of undersea cable routes that reduce overall risk and expand connectivity and broadband Internet by promoting the development of new, trusted undersea cable systems.\n\n\n\nProCON Global will engage with key decision-makers including policymakers, regulators, and technology companies (to include telecommunications operators/carriers, major technology firms, and content and cloud providers), to implement processes that evaluate and select trusted vendors when establishing their undersea cable network supply chain.\n\n\n\n**Objectives**\n\n\n\nObjective 1:  Increase understanding of policymakers, regulators, public and private sector stakeholders on the security risks, vulnerabilities, and quality/reliability issues with using untrusted vendors for commercial undersea cable and associated ecosystems.\n\n\n\nObjective 2: Improve regulatory, investment and commercial environments that promote the procurement, repair, and maintenance of secure and trusted undersea cable systems.\n\n\n\nObjective 3: Increase the use of trusted vendors for installation, repair, and maintenance of undersea cable systems and promote the use of undersea cable routes that reduce overall risk.\n\n\n\nObjective 4: Increase trusted global undersea cable routes to ensure diversity, redundancy, and resiliency.\n\n\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\n\n\nProCON Global is a direct response to telecommunications infrastructure and down-stream service needs that would enable:\n\n\n\n-    A positive and affirmative view of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet.\n\n\n\n-    An increase in secure, trusted, reliable, connectivity in underserved communities.\n\n\n\n-    An increase in understanding of policymakers, regulators, and private sector stakeholders on the security risks, vulnerabilities and quality/reliability issues with using untrusted vendors for commercial undersea cable systems and the ability to take action to address those risks.\n\n\n\n-    Data flowing freely and securely throughout the global network of undersea cables and their connected installations and software.\n\n\n\n-    Increased global data pathways: diversity, redundancy, and resiliency.\n\n\n\n-    Governments to designate undersea cables as critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\n-    Governments to agree to land trusted undersea cables and commit to using trusted undersea cables.\n\n\n\n-    Implementation of new or improved strategies and screening procedures when selecting vendors for commercial fiber-optic undersea cable systems.\n\n\n\n-    Regulations introduced to exclude untrusted suppliers and facilitate Cabotage.\n\n\n\n**Activities**\n\n\n\nTo achieve the expected project outcomes, the project must include, but not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n1\\.

        "description": " Investigator-Initiated Research Award\"**Program Description** \n\nApplications to the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) Toxic Exposures Research Program (TERP) are being solicited by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) using delegated authority provided by United States Code, Title 10, Section 4001 (10 USC 4001).  The execution management agent for this program announcement is the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) at the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC).  The TERP was initiated in FY22 to improve the scientific understanding of pathobiology from toxic exposures, more efficiently assess comorbidities, and speed the development of treatments, cures, and preventions.  Appropriations for the TERP in FY22 totaled $30 million (M).  The FY23 appropriation is $30M.\n\n\n\nThe vision of the TERP is to minimize and mitigate the impact of military-related toxic exposures and improve the health and quality of life of those affected.  The TERP aims to support impactful and highly relevant research focused on military-related toxic exposures that Service Members, Veterans, or their beneficiaries may be exposed to as a result of deployed, garrison, or other work environments and living conditions.  It is expected that research findings would also benefit the general population.\n\n\n\n***The proposed research must be relevant to active-duty Service Members, Veterans, military beneficiaries, and/or the American public.***\n\n\n\n**FY23 TERP Program Goals** \n\nTo meet the intent of the award mechanism, TERP applications must address at least one of the Program Goals listed below.

Applicants requesting support for COVID-related research should submit an administrative supplement request in response to NOT-TW-21-004 \"Notice of Special Interest: Administrative Supplements to Existing FIC Awards for COVID-19-related Research in Low- or Middle-Income Countries\".\n\nSubmission of only one administrative supplement request per FIC award is permitted; concurrent administrative supplement requests through both this NOSI initiative and NOT-TW-21-004 \"Notice of Special Interest: Administrative Supplements to Existing FIC Awards for COVID-19-related Research in Low- or Middle-Income Countries\" will not be considered.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect countries worldwide. COVID-19 mitigation efforts have affected research training efforts immeasurably. The Fogarty International Center recognizes that investigators have experienced significant research training delays and interruptions, which have especially limited progress in research training and education efforts in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).\n\nThe focus of this NOSI is to inform the research community that the FIC is supporting administrative supplements (within the scope of parent award) to cover unanticipated costs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or related mitigation efforts that could not be covered by re-budgeting existing funds. Unfortunately, available funding for such supplements is significantly limited in FY2021, and the FIC acknowledges that we will not be able to fund all requests. To stretch this funding, the FIC asks that other solutions and sources of funding be considered and exhausted before requesting additional funds and that investigators apply only in cases of significant need. FIC will only consider administrative supplements in the last year of the parent award (with the last year of the parent award beginning on or before May 1, 2021). If the parent award is renewed or other funding is subsequently obtained for proposed supplemental activities, the administrative supplement request will not be supported.\n\n\n\nProgram Priorities\n\nThe FIC will prioritize administrative supplement requests for FIC research training or education grants (e.g., D43, U2R, R25) to support LMIC trainees in master's/Ph.D programs who were not able to complete degrees due to COVID-19-related delays, but can complete their degree with one year of supplemental support. Other requests may be considered but will be regarded as a lower priority.\n\nInvestigators are strongly encouraged to contact their FIC program officer to discuss the eligibility and alignment of the proposed request with FIC priorities prior to submission.\"",

To meet these thresholds, quantum control theory must be developed that directly address those needs. The efficiency and effectiveness of these quantum control protocols must be tailored to the quantum control.\n\n\n\n**Example Approaches:**\n\n\n\nThe specific needs of quantum error correction do not necessarily imply that all quantum errors are equally bad, but this is highly dependent on the code as well as the readout ancilla preparation protocols. This in turn affects the control protocols that are applied to the qubits themselves. A co-design approach between quantum error correction and quantum control is likely to lead to better (i.e. less overhead) requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n\n\n\n**Relevance to the Intelligence Community:**\n\n\n\nDevelop/enhance understanding of quantum computing and quantum key management principles.\n\n\n\n**Key Words:** Quantum computing, quantum control theory, quantum error correction\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\nThe HPCMP CREATE TM -AV is tasked to develop, deploy, and support a set of multi-disciplinary, physics-based simulation software products for the engineering workforces supporting air vehicle acquisition programs of the services. The products are designed to exploit the capacity of next generation computer resources and enable increased capacity of the engineering workforce, reduced workloads through streamlined and more efficient engineering workflows, and minimized need for rework through early detection of aircraft design faults and performance anomalies.\n\n\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics simulations are typically run in parallel. Each simulation is different based on the size and density of the computational domain and the features selected for execution. These differences drive the scope of the distributed resources needed to execute the simulation. However, sound guidance on the optimum selection does not currently exist. The existing helps in the software only solve part of the problem. The proposed effort will work towards development of a machine learning based estimator that, using the simulation inputs, will predict the optimum processor count to set for the simulation based on the simulation inputs and a given cluster memory available per core.\n\n\n\nHPCMP CREATE TM -AV Helios is a multi-physics simulation tools focused on rotary wing applications in regular use by a wide variety of organizations to support the DoD mission. In general, improvements to this tool will improve the experience of the entire user community. This specific effort addresses a long standing issue with regards to how to decide what processor count to set on the DSRCs. Most users will learn what works and doesn't work through experience, but this takes time, doesn't guarantee that the final result is optimal, and often must be revisited when moving to a different clusters. In addition, there are situations where a poor selection will produce an error that is sometimes mistaken for a software problem and not tied to how the case was setup, delaying user progress while they work to resolve a problem that doesn't exist. The current effort will work towards developing a machine learning based predictor to help guide the user in the appropriate processor count to select for a simulation. This product will have multiple benefits, the user will experience less trial and error when executing simulations, the recommended processor count will be more optimal, saving both the user's time and making better use of the DSRC resources. Given the ever increasing popularity of Helios these gains will add up.\n\n\n\nThe development of the machine learning predictor requires multiple stages. The most critical of these is gathering a database of information with which to train the model. This data gathering is aimed at creating a predictor based on a more optimal selection rather than user experience so a wide variety of simulations will be needed to extract this information. These simulations will not only varying the problem size, but also will include a variety of different software features, vary the processor count, and use multiple clusters. In addition, while gathering data, intermediate data analysis is needed to ensure that the plan is producing results that may be used effectively in the final product by training and evaluating the machine learning framework. Note that an initial investigation into this effort has already been pursued to assess the feasibility of the concept with positive results.\n\n\n\n**What will I be doing?**\n\n\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, you will learn how to use Helios and how to interact with Helios on the DSRCs through the portal, attending weekly virtual meetings with the mentors to present intermediate results and discuss progress, writing the final required paper, and putting together a final presentation. Additional research include setting up and executing a wide variety of Helios simulations, and processing and presenting the data as it is generated. You will also be involved with initial investigations into the training, execution, and evaluation of the machine learning framework. In general, you will gain practical experience using Helios, working with the DSRCs, and learning how machine learning may be used to support the aerospace community.\n\n\n\n**Why should I apply?** This fellowship provides the opportunity to independently utilize your skills and engage with experts in innovative ideas to move the proposed research forward.\n\n\n\n**Where will I be located?** Remote\n\n\n\n**What is the anticipated start date?** June 2023 - Exact start dates will be determined at the time of selection and in coordination with the selected candidate.\n\n\n\n**What is the appointment length?** This appointment is a summer research appointment. Appointments may be extended depending on funding availability, project assignment, program rules, and availability of the participant.\n\n\n\n**About ORISE**\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and DoD.

        "title": "\"Broad Agency Announcement Ceres - Technical Area 1 (TA1): Engineer Root Communities\"",
        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** HR001123S0012\nConventional soil bioremediation is laborious, inefficient, and expensive, requiring soil preparation, nutrient delivery to remediating organisms, and continuous site monitoring. Plants and their rhizosphere microbiomes have innate potential to inexpensively perform the costliest aspects of bioremediation-soil preparation, nutrient augmentation, and site monitoring without routine human intervention. Leveraging the inherent plant-rhizosphere community, Ceres will enhance community performance by engineering synthetic communities to achieve autonomous bioremediation of a fuel, JP-8, and an explosive, TNT, from soil while overtly reporting the status of this remediation. Advances in both synthetic biology and synthetic ecology will be used to create and optimize these sophisticated synthetic communities.\n\n\n\n**1.1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW** Residual contaminants can remain in the environment following defense operations, including training. Spilled fuel and explosives such as JP-8 and TNT can significantly degrade local habitats and negatively impact the surrounding communities. Soil remediation often relies on conventional ex situ methods that laboriously and destructively excavate soil for off-site decontamination followed by extensive monitoring to track progress. Ceres aims to greatly reduce the cost of remediation by generating a platform that requires minimal energy and human intervention, leveraging the natural behaviors and processes performed by plant-microbe communities.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Ceres seeks to develop modular platforms that demonstrate proof-of-concept capabilities for two specific applications - one focused on cleaning TNT or JP-8 and the other on indicating the presence of TNT and JP-8. The Cleaner Track will develop synthetic plant-\n\nrhizosphere microbial communities that would degrade the targeted contaminant down to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved levels without dangerous byproducts. The Beacon Track will develop a complementary plant-microbe synthetic community that would provide an overt signal that the target contamination has been reduced to EPA-approved levels.\n\nProposers may chose a Combined Track to address both Cleaner and Beacon for TNT or JP-8.\n\n\n\n**1.2. TECHNICAL APPROACH** Plants communicate with and control the surrounding soil community in myriad ways. For instance, root exudates enhance rhizosphere organisms, controlling both free-living and root-\n\nsymbiont microbial community dynamics and metabolism. Reciprocally, microorganisms in the rhizosphere communicate with the plant via metabolites that enable, for example, the plant to increase nutrient uptake. Ceres will leverage these multi-kingdom plant-rhizosphere communities, engineering them into cohesive synthetic communities with optimized track-specific functions.\n\n\n\nProposers are expected to (1) isolate or assemble functional plant-microbe communities; (2) HR001123S0012, Ceres optimize the communities through biological and ecological engineering into synthetic communities; (3) develop controls so that the synthetic communities can be easily removed post remediation; and (4) generate realistic testbeds that mimic field conditions for synthetic community optimizing and testing. Proposers should describe how they will biocontrol the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using current biocontainment strategies, such as those established through synthetic biology, while also developing ecological containment approaches.\n\n\n\n**1.5.1. Technical Area 1 (TA1):** Engineer Root Communities Plants and their rhizosphere communities consist of many intricate biotic relationships. During Phase I, proposers will obtain or generate rhizosphere microbial communities specific to the chosen plant species. Rhizosphere communities can be assembled or supplemented with organisms from existing collections or identified through bioprospecting at the beginning of the program.\n\nThis community will be optimized and integrated into the target plant's rhizosphere. Optimization for the target function, Beacon or Cleaner, can leverage techniques from both synthetic ecology (e.g., iterative selective enrichment) and synthetic biology (e.g., CRISPR). For the Beacon Track, proposers should implement a clear signaling pathway that avoids crosstalk with compounds common in the soil. During Phase II, the function and stability of the rhizosphere microbial communities will be advanced. Track-specific functionality will be further enhanced, including level of detection (Beacon) or degradation rate (Cleaner). Proposals should justify the choice of obtaining the microbial community and the relative merits of the community engineering strategy.\n\nMoreover, the proposal should include risk mitigation for their strategies, addressing both potential deleterious processes, such as enhancement of pathogenicity, and the known challenges such as those associated with eventual field-deployment.\"",

If the countermeasure is not  preinstalled, it must be rapidly and remotely deployable on command.\n\n    \n\n-   **Requirements and exclusions**\n\n    \n\n    A variety of physical defensive approaches have been employed in the recent past to counter UAS attacks against both mobile assets and fixed installations. In recent conflicts, for example, protective canopies have been used to reduce the effect of UAS strikes/munition drops for assets on the move.  The issue with such approaches is that they can be seen by opposing forces who can then plan and adopt alternative attack approaches to counter them.  This competition seeks to move us beyond such limitations by introducing innovative approaches where protective capability can be deployed in a covert or discreet manner and activated automatically, where necessary, at the point of need.\n\n    \n\n    As a minimum, the system needs to be rapidly deployable either by an operator or automatically as the last line of defence to protect an asset. However, the ideal system should be capable of passive deployment without the need for human intervention. Either way, the system may require a degree of early warning which could come from an existing UAS Detect, Track and Identify technology.\n\n    \n\n    Out of scope ideas for this competition include established off the shelf technology which looks to directly interdict the air vehicle either;\n\n    \n\n    1.  Electronically i.e. to jam, take control, or spoof the command link or GNSS of a UAS.\n\n    2.  or by using an active kinetic effect on the drone (i.e. high intensity lasers, EMPs, ammunition, etc.)\n\n    \n\n-   **Challenge 1: Protecting a static asset**\n\n    \n\n    This challenge is focused on providing protection to temporarily static or permanently fixed assets from hostile UAS, including assets that are either important to the functioning of a site or may pose a hazard to life or other assets if targeted in an attack.\n\n    \n\n    An example scenario might include providing last ditch protection to pressurised fuel supply or storage systems at a refuelling station within Critical National Infrastructure against a hostile Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) carrying an explosive, where primary C-UAS systems have proven ineffective.\n\n    \n\n    The solution should be deployable in a covert manner, easily hidden or masked so that basic reconnaissance will not result in the threat actor redirecting a mission to avoid the physical countermeasures deployed.  An ideal solution should be rapidly deployable by a remote operator if there is a credible UAS threat inbound.\n\n    \n\n    For temporary assets, the solution needs to be easily redeployable, i.e. portable or semi-portable, so that it can be easily moved if the asset changes location or as the threat changes.\n\n    \n\n-   **Challenge 2: Protecting an asset on the move**\n\n    \n\n    This challenge is focused on providing protection from hostile UAS to a moving asset. This might include a land or maritime vehicle, convoy of vehicles, or a person.\n\n    \n\n    A typical example might include providing last resort protection to a protected person in a moving vehicle against an attack from a UAV, or protecting an asset in transport which may pose a hazard to life or other assets should it be subjected to an attack.\n\n    \n\n    Such systems need to be fully portable rather than easily deployable so that they can be moved with the asset as it changes location or as the threat changes, as well as rapidly deployable/initiated remotely to protect the asset as the last line of defence if there is a credible UAS threat inbound.\n\n    \n\n    We need a solution that can be deployable in a covert manner, easily hidden or masked so that basic reconnaissance will not result in the threat actor redirecting a mission to avoid the physical countermeasures deployed.\"",

        "description": "\"Stable and radiogenic isotopic mapping of geologic terranes across large regions provides unique insights into mineral system and tectonomagmatic evolution of critical mineral-bearing belts of Alaska. Alaska's complex geology is well suited for this approach**Description of the Research Opportunity**  \n\n\n\nCritical mineral enrichments occur in association with a wide variety of mineral systems and tectonic environments. Recent work has shown that precursor (i.e., Paleozoic) tectonic and magmatic events and crustal structure influenced the enrichment of critical minerals as by-products in Mesozoic mineral systems in Alaska (e.g., Kreiner et al., 2019). Many different styles of mineral systems are known or suspected to occur throughout the state, resulting from the diversity of geologic terranes and tectonic environments in which they originally formed, tectonic processes during accretion, and syn- and post-accretionary tectonic processes.\n\n\n\nMuch of southwestern Alaska is composed of magmatic arcs, accretionary complexes, and continental fragments. The boundaries between these features are often obscured by overlap successions of Cretaceous basin stratigraphy. The heritage and deep crustal architecture of most terranes are difficult to ascertain due to incomplete exposure and a lack of systematic investigation using modern analytical techniques. Mineral systems formed throughout the geologic evolution of the region, with various critical metal enrichments. Mineral systems can be divided into pre-, syn-, and post-Cretaceous origins. The pre-Cretaceous mineral systems formed as a result of tectonic processes that occurred during the formation of the continental fragments. Syn-Cretaceous mineral systems span accretionary-derived tectonic settings and multiple pulses of magmatic arc activity. Post-Cretaceous systems formed following the accretion of the continental fragments and are the result of magmatic arcs and young Cenozoic faulting. The tectonic setting, and origin of many mineral occurrences in the region remains enigmatic - including the giant Donlin gold deposit which contains large resources of Sb and As in addition to Au.\n\n\n\nThe information generated by the Mendenhall Fellow will have broad appeal to geologists interested in the relationship between crustal evolution and architecture and the formation and distribution of mineral deposits, the geologic evolution of accretionary orogens, and the isotopic composition and evolution of the crust and mantle in different tectonic environments. The findings will also be of great interest to the public who in recent years have become more aware of critical mineral resources and their presence in the United States and to various stakeholders in Alaska such as land managers and the minerals industry who rely on the USGS for informed, data-driven mineral resources research and assessments.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the research will be to use some combination of radiogenic (e.g., Pb, Rb-Sr, Nd, Hf, etc.) and(or) stable (e.g., O, H, S, C, N) isotope systems in bedrock, sediment, and mineralization lode samples to map the isotopic signatures and interpret the tectonic affinity and geologic evolution of the region. The proposed work may address one or more fundamental questions that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  What is the age and isotopic character of the basement to the accreted terranes in southwestern Alaska?\n\n-  How are igneous systems distributed, and what is the history and tectonic setting of magmatic activity in the region?\n\n-  What are potential linkages between crustal architecture, magmatic composition, and critical mineral endowment of mineral systems in southwest Alaska?\n\n-  How do accretionary processes modify original mineral systems and resource endowments?\n\n-  What is the age, geometry, and evolution of accretionary boundaries and potential control on mineral systems in the region?\n\n\n\nThese questions require a better and more integrated understanding of both the exposed bedrock geologic framework and regions that are concealed beneath overlap successions and younger cover. Once exposed regions are characterized, the same isotopic mapping approach can be applied to regions with poor bedrock exposure concealed beneath Cretaceous overlap basins or Quaternary colluvial, alluvial and vegetated cover. In poorly exposed regions, samples of modern and recent detrital sediment can be used as proxies to assess the isotopic and geochemical signature of defined catchments and to infer the origin and nature of the underlying bedrock. A full integration of geochronologic data with isotopic characteristics will provide a powerful and efficient means of studying crustal evolution, identifying crustal domains, mapping mineral systems, and evaluating the inherent controls on metallogenic potential and enrichments of critical elements in diverse geologic terranes.\n\n\n\nThe USGS Earth Mapping Resource Initiative (Earth MRI) is a high-profile, national mapping, data collection, synthesis and interpretation program focused on the Nation's need for critical mineral independence and security. This initiative has multiple new geophysical surveys in Alaska in three priority areas-the Yukon-Tanana upland, the Kuskokwim Mountains region, and the Seward Peninsula and new geologic mapping and geochemical sampling in the Yukon-Tanana upland. Additional geochemical, and geologic mapping in these regions is ongoing. The successful Mendenhall Fellow will coordinate and integrate with this work and develop necessary datasets for better understanding the distribution of geologic basement domains, crustal architecture, and terrane evolution. The Fellow will benefit from collaborations with research staff inovled in Earth MRI in Alaska and other ASC geologists to better understand the bedrock geology of the region, as well as collaboration and mentorship from state and academic partners working to better understand the mineral systems hosting critical mineral resources. Suitable samples can be collected from a combination of active field work and research in southwest Alaska and augmented with archived materials curated by USGS. Limited new fieldwork, conducted in conjunction with active research in the region, may target specific areas for focused work.\n\n\n\nInterested applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Research Advisor(s) early in the application process to discuss project ideas*.*\"",

Objective:  \n\nPlease refer to the \"Specific Challenges and Objectives\" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under 'Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents'.  \n\nScope:  \n\nThe scope of the target project covers:  \n\n\n\n\\- EU US R&I cooperation on key next generation wireless including 6G technologies and architectures powered by Artificial Intelligence. AI may be considered at various levels from a future target 6G systems, from lower layer radio aspects (e.g. reconfigurable waveform, Reflective Intelligent Surface processing, etc.) to higher layers targeting intelligent function placement, network self-configuration, security and resilience, or AI based support of user applications.  \n\n\\- Support to a reference framework for AI usage for the telecommunications domain in relation to 6G, including methodologies, reference use cases, data acquisition and generation, repositories, curated training and evaluation data, as well as the technologies and functionalities needed to use it as a benchmarking platform for future AI/ML solutions for 6G networks. The framework may address a wide range of usage contexts, covering both different applications areas of AI (e.g. physical layer, networking, security), and different business ecosystems (e.g. typical end to end network operators, open networks, cloud and infrastructure operators, federated and virtual operators). Typical 6G metrics should be able to be evaluated, including data rate, latency, density, energy efficiency, flexibility and performance, and/or security. Methods of accreditation of usage/compliance may also be considered to validate techniques.  \n\n\\- The scope includes availability of data sets, contributing to 6G Human Centricity and Societal acceptance and in compliance with the rules of data legislation, both existing and new ones created by the project, that may be used by researchers to validate AI approaches and inference rules applied to the selected network/device challenge. Contribution to the framework and data access is expected to add value, notably for improvement and expansion of data sets, tools and algorithms for efficient new AI/ML solutions. Generation and exchange of data across EU-US stakeholders is in scope where possible and appropriate. Proposals on validation of AI techniques over experimental platforms, additionally providing the associated datasets, are in scope.   \n\nApplicants are invited to explain how the EU-US cooperation will be implemented, i.e., the target US initiative to collaborate with and the approach of cooperation to be deployed with US stakeholders. The retained project is expected to work with relevant US funded project(s). Only organisations established in the EU and associated countries will be eligible for EU funding.\"",

Scope:  \n\nThe following two types of innovation proposals are expected.   \n\n\n\n\\- i. The development of XR applications to support companies in all industrial ecosystems, especially SMEs, to use innovative interactive and immersive technologies, increasing their competitiveness, productivity, efficiency and human-centricity. The applications should be robust, gender-neutral safe and trustworthy, especially in terms of cybersecurity, privacy and health issues. Proposals should exploit cross fertilisation between academics, industry representatives and end-users around well thought-out scenarios. Moreover, proposals should include activities to showcase the results, widely disseminating and exploiting the outcomes.   \n\nAt least one proposal of innovation Type I will be funded.   \n\n\n\n\\- ii. The creation of a European reference platform aiming to develop and prototype advanced interoperable XR solutions to solve common challenges encountered by the industry (in areas such as assembly, maintenance, remote operation, training, design, logistics, etc.), placing the wellbeing of workers at the centre of the production process. The platform will be populated with third party-projects exploring a wide range of XR technologies and taking benefit of other emerging technologies (such as 5G/6G, IoT, data, artificial intelligence, edge and cloud computing, and microelectronics). In order to facilitate the integration with existing IT systems and policies, the EU XR platform for industry should prioritize XR content, tools and solutions based on open standards, such as OpenXR and WebXR. The solutions provided by the platform should aim to cover as many industry ecosystems as possible. Involvement of end-users is essential in defining specifications and testing.   \n\nOnly one proposal will be funded for innovation Type II.  \n\n\n\nFinancial support to third parties  \n\n\n\nThe type ii innovation action should provide financial support to third-party projects from outstanding XR innovators, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors through a minimum of three open calls during the lifetime of the project.  \n\n\n\nAs support and mobilising of XR innovators is key to the type ii IA of this topic, a minimum of 60% of the total requested EU contribution should be allocated to financial support to the third parties. Proposals should define a coherent and coordinated programme logic for the third-party projects, offering the necessary technical support, coaching and mentoring, to ensure a significant advancement and impact in the innovation domain, including in terms of interoperability and standardisation. These tasks should be financed outside of the minimum allocated share for financial support to third parties.   \n\n\n\nProposals should make explicit the intervention logic for the area and their potential to attract relevant top XR talents and to deliver a solid value-added to the third-party projects. Proposals should also prove the expertise and capacity of the consortium in managing the full life-cycle of the open calls transparently and efficiently.  \n\n\n\nThe Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.  \n\n\n\nThird parties in type ii should be funded through projects typically in the EUR 250 000 to 500 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 12 to 15 months.  \n\n\n\nThis topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.  \n\nSpecific Topic Conditions:  \n\n\n\nActivities are expected to start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 7-8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.  \n\n\n\n[1]The term industry in this context encompasses all ecosystems defined in the European industrial strategy\"",

The size of grants ranges from £500-£5Trustees favour support for items which directly improve the patient experience and the standard of palliative care services for people of all ages. For this round, prevention of and protection against Covid-19 for health workers, patients and their families will be included as crosscutting issues across all the funding priorities. This round the sponsor is therefore accepting applications for work designed to allow services to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.   \n\n\n\nThe priority areas for the programme are as follows:  \n\n\n\n* Training courses for palliative care service providers held in Africa (applicants must supply a curriculum / outline of the topics to be covered, Curriculum vitae (CVs) of the trainers, fill out the training template and supply the name of the accrediting body. Funds will be released on receiving the letter of acceptance for the training institution for those applying to undertake courses). For this round, training in dealing with Covid-19, including prevention, containment, referral, vaccination and use of PPE, will also be considered.  \n\n* Equipment for patients (e.g. beds, wheelchairs). For this round, equipment may also include PPEs for staff and patients, or any other equipment to support palliative care patients for prevention of Covid-19  \n\n* Projects supporting paediatric palliative care services (this could include purchasing toys, integrating paediatric services into an existing programme, developing materials for advocacy, etc.).   \n\n* Palliative care Essential Medicines and Personal Protection Equipment. For this round, medicines and equipment may include that intended to ensure the safety of patients and staff including PPE; masks, aprons, gowns, face shields, temperature guns, hand sanitiser, soap, etc.   \n\n* Capital improvement costs (such as refurbishing buildings to improve the patient experience, buying furniture, etc.)   \n\n\n\n* Developing small palliative care projects (integrating palliative care components into existing health care services, adapting palliative care models, quality improvement activities such as Palliative Care standards, developing materials among others. and helping health care providers to establish new palliative care projects where none currently exist. For this round, applications for the costs of adapting existing projects and services in light of the Covid-19 crisis will be considered.   \n\n* Increasing access to palliative care services in rural areas. For this round, applications for work on sensitising palliative care patients and communities about Covid-19 transmission, prevention and vaccination will be considered. We will also consider applications towards the costs of airtime or virtual visiting for palliative care patients.  \n\n* For this round, applications towards the costs of airtime, data, devices or software packages for remote service delivery, training, mentorship or meetings will be considered.   \n\n* Responding to crisis situations such as extreme weather conditions or disease outbreaks to deal with their effects on the provision of palliative care services.  \n\n* Trustees will prioritise applications from organisations with an annual income of under $500,000.\"",

        "description": "\"Notice Number: NOT-OD-24-145  \n**Purpose**  \n\n\n\n****Purpose****  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this notice is to encourage the submission of \"permission-to-submit\" applications for R13 proposals seeking funding for the support of scientific conferences and workshops that will bring together subject matter experts in autoimmune disease research with the goal of developing and refining Common Data Elements (CDEs) for autoimmune disease research.\n\n\n\nThe use of CDEs [supports](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/nihDataSharing) the [2023 NIH Data Management and Sharing](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/intramural-program-oversight/intramural-data-sharing/2023-nih-data-management-sharing-policy) Policy by facilitating harmonization of data from different studies and interoperability. \n\n\n\n****Background****  \n\n\n\nIn 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, [*Enhancing NIH Research on Autoimmune Disease*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593778/%22%20/l%20%22:~:text=Enhancing%20NIH%20Research%20on%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20also%20calls,years%29%20to%20study%20disease%20across%20the%20life%20course), examined NIH research efforts related to autoimmune diseases. Subsequently, Congress, via the [Joint Explanatory Statement](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Division%20H%20-%20LHHS%20Statement%20FY23.pdf) accompanying the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, directed the establishment of the [Office of Autoimmune Disease Research](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/oadr-orwh) in the [Office of Research on Women's Health](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/) (OADR-ORWH) and instructed the office to:\n\n\n\n-  **Coordinate development of a multi-institute and center (IC) strategic research plan;**\n\n-  **Identify emerging areas of innovation and research opportunity;**\n\n-  **Coordinate and foster collaborative research across ICs;**\n\n-  **Annually evaluate the NIH autoimmune disease research portfolio;**\n\n-  **Provide resources to support planning, collaboration, and innovation; and**\n\n-  **Develop a publicly accessible central repository for autoimmune disease research.**\n\n\n\nThe NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Strategic Plan 2017-2027 identify common data elements (CDEs) as a mechanism to facilitate data interoperability.\n\n\n\nThe NIH CDE Repository was launched in 2015 and provides access to structured human and machine-readable definitions of data elements that have been recommended or required by NIH institutes and centers (ICs) and other organizations for use in research and for other purposes. The NIH CDEs endorsement process involves review by an expert panel to ensure that proposed CDEs meet established criteria and approved CDEs are included in the NIH CDE Repository.\n\n\n\nCurrently, numerous CDEs are utilized by researchers in autoimmune disease research but very few CDEs have been endorsed by the NLM. To provide resources to support planning and collaboration for CDEs endorsement for the autoimmune disease research community, OADR is seeking letters of interest from groups interested in developing endorsed CDEs for specific areas of autoimmune disease research.\n\n\n\n****Description****  \n\n\n\nSuccessful applicants are expected to work in consultation with OADR and respective NIH institute, center, and office (ICO) program staff to establish an organizing committee. This should include representatives from across the autoimmune disease research community and other interested parties.\n\n\n\nOADR, respective ICO program staff, and staff from the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) will assist the Program Director(s) (PD(s))/Principal Investigator(s) (PI(s)) with the processes required for obtaining NLM endorsement of CDEs. The PD(s)/PI(s) will have primary responsibility for defining objectives and approaches, planning, coordinating, and validating proposed CDEs.\n\n\n\n****Funding Mechanism****  \n\n\n\nThe website, [NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r13/index.htm), centralizes information regarding grants for scientific conferences. The [Contacts and Special Interests](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/contacts/IC-specific-information-PA-24-141.html) section of that website includes contact information for the participating ICs as well as information about each IC's specific interests and funding parameters.\n\n\n\nNote: Applicants are encouraged to look at the [R13 Frequently Asked Questions](https://grants.nih.gov/faqs#/conference-grants-r13.htm) for a listing of common questions regarding the preparation and submission of conference grant applications. Applicants are also recommended to consult the [OADR portfolio list](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/OADR-ORWH/ADR-Across-NIH) to ensure their focus area is within the scope of OADR.\n\n\n\nThe application budget should reflect the actual needs of the proposed project but should not exceed $75,000 total costs requested annually. Depending on the needs of the community, this may be divided into several workshops over the course of a year to allow the community to come together to build consensus on CDE development. \n\n\n\n****Permission to Submit Letter****  \n\n\n\nThe OADR \"permission-to-submit\" letter is required in the R13 application. Applicants are urged to initiate contact with OADR at least six weeks prior to the anticipated receipt date. Please note that agreement to consider an application does not guarantee funding. \n\n\n\nOnce permission to submit a full R13 application is obtained, applications should be submitted through **PA-24-141.**\"",

Newkirk Jr., astrophysicist, creator of the HAO [white-light coronagraph](https://www2.hao.ucar.edu/mlso/instruments/mk3-mk4-coronameters) and a former HAO director. Newkirk's balloon observations laid the groundwork for successful spaceborne experiments by the observatory. This fellowship program has supported graduate research at HAO for decades.\n\n\n\nThe Newkirk Fellowship provides financial support for research visits to HAO allowing for 3-6 months per year in a single visit. The total supported visit length is 9 months, which can be spread out over up to three years. A visit within one year of program acceptance is mandatory and all visits to HAO must occur while the student is enrolled in a graduate program.\n\n\n\nHAO provides financial support to Newkirk Fellows for one visit per year, including:\n\n\n\n-    Airfare\n\n-    Stipend of $4,000 per month\n\nAdditionally, HAO will cover travel expenses for the student's university advisor/mentor to visit HAO (one trip of up to two weeks' duration). The advisor/mentor visit is not mandatory, but is highly recommended and has to occur while the student is present at HAO.

        "description": "\"**About Alberta Innovates**\nInnovation is the catalyst for sustainable jobs, economic and community strength, improved health and environmental benefits.\n\nAlberta Innovates leads and accelerates innovation from discovery to use across all sectors in all parts of the province. As Alberta's largest research and innovation agency, we are uniquely positioned to propel great ideas forward to improve the lives of Albertans today and for generations to come.\n\nAlberta Innovates believes the research and innovation (R&I) ecosystem is stronger and more sustainable when it is broadly representative of the overall diversity of our community. We strive to ensure that all interested and qualified parties have an equitable opportunity to participate and contribute to the ecosystem and that our processes are inclusive.\n\nThe projects that our programs invest in are critical to how Alberta Innovates achieves positive impact for Albertans in alignment with the Government of Alberta s R&I priorities, as expressed in our corporate Business Plan. (See the most recent Business Plan on our Publications page on our website.) Accordingly, it is essential for project outcomes to align with those of the program.\n\nThe AICE-Validate Program is managed through the Health Innovation and Platforms business unit within Alberta Innovates. The Health Innovation and Platforms group works closely with health service delivery partners, innovators, researchers, and patients to:\n\n-      facilitate the testing and adoption of novel care models that are powered by emerging technologies;\n\n-      deliver skills development opportunities and build partnerships to help grow the talent needed to drive our future health economy;\n\n-      work collaboratively with innovators to understand and reduce barriers that will accelerate innovations into care; and\n\n-      build, integrate, and sustain platforms and activities to support a health innovation ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Program Overview**\n\n\n\nAlberta Innovates supports the advancement and commercialization of emerging health technology through the Accelerating Innovations into CarE (AICE) suite of programs. The goal is to simultaneously deliver economic outcomes to Alberta and health impact at home and abroad. Emerging technologies, particularly digital and data-enabled technologies, are enabling the development of patient-focused clinical solutions, new models of care, digital therapeutics, and an acceleration of research into innovation that will form the future foundation of a more affordable, accessible, and high-quality health system for all Albertans. The acceleration of new health technologies to market will attract external investment and grow the life sciences industry as a viable job creator and source of economic prosperity in Alberta.\n\nThe Accelerating Innovations in CarE (AICE)-Validate program (\"The Program\"), specifically provides support for Alberta innovators that have proof of concept and are now ready to refine and validate their health technology and value proposition.\n\nThe objectives of the AICE-Validate program are to:\n\n-      advance commercialization of health technologies with potential to improve health outcomes and generate economic returns to Alberta; and\n\n-      enable Alberta health technology innovators to validate their product value proposition to enable follow-on private investment and/or revenue generation.\n\nProjects are supported to advance Product-Market Fit, Business Readiness, Regulatory Compliance, and Product Development during the committing and early validation phases of their commercialization journey (see figure below).\n\n\n\n**Overview**\n\n\n\nAICE Validate provides funding support for Alberta-based researchers and SMEs developing health technologies. These technologies hold potential to generate a successful business, leading to positive economic and health outcomes for Albertans. The program is focused on the Committing and early Validating stages of the Health Innovation Client Journey Framework (see below).\n\n\n\nClick the infographic to see details of each step and to assess your fit to the program:\n\n\n\n[![](https://albertainnovates.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AICE-Validate_client_journey_graphic-300x129.png)](https://albertainnovates.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AICE-Validate_client_journey_graphic.png)\n\n\n\nFunding will help researchers and SMEs demonstrate the feasibility of their emerging venture and validate their product, market fit, business model and regulatory path.

        "description": " Rights**ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION** \n\n**I. INTRODUCTION** \n\nAs articulated in the Agency's LGBTQI+ Inclusive Development Policy (August 2023), USAID supports the enactment of robust protections, inclusion, and human rights for all LGBTQI+ individuals through\n\n\"inclusive development,\" an equitable development approach built on the understanding that every individual and community, of all diverse identities and experiences, is instrumental in the transformation of their own societies. The Policy s desired outcome is a world in which LGBTQI+ persons can live with dignity and freedom from all forms of violence, discrimination, stigma, and criminalization. In this world, LGBTQI+ persons are able to participate fully in civic and democratic processes; they have equal access to sustainable livelihoods, economic assets, and resources; they have full access to education, health, mental health, and other services that are essential for personal well-being and growth (including sexual and reproductive health and rights and comprehensive sexuality education); and, importantly, they are supported in times of emergency. The Policy is based on five foundational principles: 1) Be Proactive While Continuing to Uphold the Principle of  Do No Harm ;\n\n2) Follow the Lead of Local LGBTQI+ Activists and Groups and Act with Humility and in Allyship; 3) See the Full Person and Work to Meet Diverse Needs; 4) Understand the Landscape, History, Stakeholders, and What Has Worked; and 5) Recognize the Need for Targeting, Tailoring, and Differentiating LGBTQI+ Programs and that One Size Does Not Fit All.\n\nThe Policy - along with USAID s LGBTQI+ programming - builds upon the Yogyakarta Principles and YP+10, a set of principles that interpret and apply international human rights law to people with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC). Created by experts from around the world, these principles lay out a strong framework for State obligations to ensure justice, rights, and security for LGBTQI+ persons. The LGBTQI+ Addendum under the Justice, Rights, and Security (JRS) Annual Program Statement (APS) aims to resource civil society organizations (CSOs) and/or coalitions in USAID presence countries to support regional/multi-country initiatives that advance the holistic development of LGBTQI+ populations by advancing the right to education, the right to decent work, the right to protection from poverty, right to the highest attainable standard of health and protection from medical abuse, and to more effectively respond to the harmful effects of anti-rights actors.\n\n\n\n**PURPOSE** \n\nThe purpose of the JRS APS, as stated in the initial announcement, is to empower USAID and its Missions to seek solutions to JRS-related challenges, to engage new and underutilized partners, to solve problems not adequately addressed by other USAID investments, and to offer USAID Missions and USAID/Washington Offices a mechanism through which such work can be innovatively accomplished with dedicated support and expertise from USAID Washington DRG Center's JRS team. The specific purpose of the LGBTQI+ Addendum is to support regional/multi-country initiatives to advance the holistic development of LGBTQI+ populations (i.e., securing their rights to employment, education, livelihoods, and access to basic services) and to more effectively respond to the harmful effects of anti-rights actors.\n\nObjectives and Illustrative Strategic Approaches:\n\nThe LGBTQI+ Addendum to the JRS APS has three primary objectives:\n\n -     Objective #1: Advance the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals and communities to access education, professional development, livelihoods, and employment opportunities;\n\n-      Objective #2: Advance the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals to access quality basic health services, including mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS); and\n\n-      Objective #3: Advance the ability of regional/multi-country organizations and/or coalitions to effectively respond to and counter anti-rights actors.\n\n\n\nThese objectives contribute to goals #2 and #3 of the JRS APS:\n\n -     JRS APS Goal #2: Protect rights, especially those objectives to improve the enabling environments for the protection and advancement of human rights; to promote equal and equitable enjoyment of human rights by all; and\n\n-      JRS APS Goal #3: Promote security, especially the objective to safeguard all members of society from crime and violence, including gender-based violence so they may live safely and recognize their full potential \n\n\n\nTo meet these objectives, USAID encourages concepts that combine intentional capacity strengthening and organizational development, sub-granting, knowledge exchange, and leadership building in order to strengthen LGBTQI+ leaders, organizations, and networks, with a particular interest in supporting historically underfunded sub-populations (i.e., LBQ+, intersex, transgender, and non-binary people) and regions. USAID will prioritize LGBTQI+-led organizations located in USAID presence countries and will consider applications from U.S.- and Global North-based organizations only in the absence of eligible regional/sub-regional organizations.\n\nStrong applicants will demonstrate sufficient capacity to successfully administer USAID funding, a track-record of maintaining high-trust relationships with and centering the leadership of most-impacted communities, the ability to navigate complex power dynamics with humility and respect, and provide partner-identified accompaniment and capacity-building support, as needed/requested. Similarly, strong applicants will likewise adopt an intersectional lens and demonstrate how they will ensure that programming reaches the most vulnerable members of the LGBTQI+ community, including those who face multiple layers of stigmatization and discrimination due to socioeconomic status, age, disability, ethnicity, etc.\n\nGiven the safety and security risks inherent in this work, there can be many unplanned/unforeseen circumstances (i.e., individuals participating in projects get arrested, detained, evicted, threatened, abused, etc.). USAID recommends that applicants consider setting aside a minimum ten percent of total funding for adaptive management and emergency response grants outside of the typical grant/project cycle would help protect and support beneficiaries facing violence and discrimination related to their work under this activity.\n\n\n\n**Objective #1: Advance the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals and communities to access education, professional development, employment opportunities, and sustainable livelihoods.**\n\nDue to high levels of stigma and discrimination and criminalizing and punitive laws and policies, LGBTQI+ people face unique challenges to securing employment and sustainable livelihoods. This often begins in the education sector, where LGBTQI+ students often do not have the support of educators to help address anti-LGBTQI+ violence or bullying, as described in USAID s Integrating LGBTQI+\n\nConsiderations Into Education Programming Guide. LGBTQI+ students are more likely to feel unsafe at school and therefore avoid school activities, drop out of school, and underperform academically compared to their peers. Relatedly, LGBTQI+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and are more likely to drop out of school and become homeless.\n\nWith the majority of USAID-presence countries lacking any SOGIESC-related legal protections, LGBTQI+\n\nindividuals may face discrimination in hiring, unfair termination, verbal and/or physical harassment, and lower pay, among many other challenges. As a result of estrangement and rejection from their families, 4\n\nLGBTQI+ people often lack the family/social support structures that many others have and, due to an often corresponding limited education opportunities, may also lack financial literacy and access to capital.\n\nIllustrative strategic approaches for this objective may include, but are not limited to:\n\n-      Developing and disseminating anti-bullying resources and campaigns in partnership with schools, Ministries of Education, civil society organizations, and others to promote LGBTQI+ inclusion in schools and curriculums;\n\n-      Empowering LGBTQI+ individuals with job skills and vocational training (including English language training) based on an assessment of the training needs and job market opportunities;\n\n-      Supporting the development of industry or professional associations that support LGBTQI+-owned businesses or businesses that provide services/products for the LGBTQI+ community.\n\n-      Training/capacity development for LGBTQI+ business owners and businesses providing services to the LGBTQI+ community on (a) legal protections that apply to them under the law and (b) modalities for recourse in case of discrimination and/or for keeping public authorities and private entities accountable to the law.\n\n-      Working with banks, lending and micro-lending institutions, etc. to educate lenders on the benefits of supporting LGBTQI+-run businesses, to identify LGBTQI+-friendly institutions and networks, and to connect LGBTQI+ entrepreneurs to existing sources of capital;\n\n-      Identifying the primary barriers to LGBTQI+ employment and liaising with businesses, chambers of commerce, trade unions, and (where possible) governments to make the case for the benefits of an inclusive workforce and to promote inclusive human resource and safety/security policies (including in gig economies) and LGBTQI+ individuals  access to decent work;\n\n-      Improving the financial literacy of LGBTQI+ individuals and organizations; and\n\n-      Training and developing sustainability plans with income generating activities and/or social enterprise schemes for CSOs/CBOs.\n\n\n\n**Objective #2: Advance the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals and communities to access quality basic health services, including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services** \n\nJust as LGBTQI+ individuals are disproportionately affected by unemployment, they likewise face higher rates of both communicable and non-communicable diseases than cisgender, heterosexual people. This is due to many well-researched social determinants, including stigma and discrimination in health services. At worst, members of the LGBTQI+ community are subjected to harmful practices or denied health services altogether; at best, they are seen by health professionals with little understanding or knowledge of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC), nor of the unique health (including MHPSS) needs of community members - especially members of transgender communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the world, LGBTQI+ individuals are pathologized for their SOGIESC, and, in many cases, they are forced to undergo harmful, traumatizing, and scientifically debunked practices and treatments by way of so-called  conversion therapy  practices (CTP) or intersex genital mutilation (IGM) surgeries. Efforts to repress, change, or  cure  diverse sexual orientations, gender identities, and/or variations in sex characteristics occur in nearly every part of the world, and these practices not only do not work, but they cause lasting psychological (and sometimes physical) trauma to LGBTQI+ individuals. Despite the clear dangers of CTP, only thirteen countries have banned the practice altogether.\n\nIndividuals who are born with intersex characteristics, or natural variations in sex characteristics (sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, hormonal structure and/or levels, and/or chromosomal patterns) that do not fit the typical definitions or expectations of  female  or  male  bodies are subject to medical violence, discrimination, and abuse. Many intersex persons, particularly infants and children, experience nonconsensual, invasive, unnecessary, and often irreversible medical procedures, often referred to as  intersex genital mutilation,  or IGM. IGM is fundamentally a violation of an intersex individual s right to make autonomous and informed decisions about their own body, and the impacts of IGM have implications for the right to health, education, and employment.\n\nIllustrative strategic approaches for this objective may include, but are not limited to:\n\n -     Developing training, guidelines, and resources in local languages for health professionals and mental health providers on LGBTQI+-inclusion, confidentiality, and/or standards of and consent to care for intersex, gender non-conforming, and transgender individuals;\n\n-      Developing digital referral networks of affirming health and mental health care providers;\n\n-      Developing and supporting holistic care and wrap-around health (including mental health) services for survivors from so-called CTP or IGM, including community-based service delivery;\n\n-      Creating alliances with activists and CSOs, faith leaders, religious institutions, supportive parents, health professionals, legislators, supportive parents, and/or public health officials to debunk the myths around and educate on the dangers of so-called CTP and IGM;\n\n-      Supporting research to better understand the scope and types of so-called CTP and IGM and the development of tailored, localized strategies and approaches to combat it;\n\n-      Strengthening the capacity of LGBTQI+-led health organizations to expand community-led programs beyond HIV services, and be more inclusive of of diverse LGBTQI+ populations; and\n\n-      Developing and training peer-led support groups, with an emphasis on normalizing challenges with mental health and burn-out prevention for LGBTQI+ activists, including various forms of wellbeing support modalities .\n\n\n\n**Objective #3: Advance the ability of LGBTQI+-led organizations and/or coalitions to effectively respond to and counter anti-rights actors**.\n\nTransnational actors and their influences challenge democratic norms and social cohesion that have made gains in several countries over the past decade. These actors and influences often manifest through targeted attacks on women s rights, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and LGBTQI+ rights, often under the guise of protecting children and family values. These attacks are used as 'wedge  issues to initiate more broad-based efforts to undermine rule of law, freedom of assembly and association, free and independent media, and democratic elections.\n\nActivists globally continue to cite the lack of accurate, research-based, and affirming content on SOGIESC in local languages as both a significant challenge to combating anti-LGBTQI+ stigma and a key cause in the rise of anti-LGBTQI+ violence and discrimination. In tandem, the ubiquity of mis- and disinformation has been leveraged by anti-rights actors to control and distort the discourse about diverse SOGIESC. This has resulted in LGBTQI+ individuals being targeted during and blamed for3\n\nCOVID-19 while also suffering disproportionately from the economic fallout due to systemic inequities and underlying health conditions. The dearth of accurate, factual information in local languages - not only for members of the LGBTQI+ community, but for family members, policymakers, medical and legal professionals, journalists and media professionals, among others - is a significant gap that LGBTQI+-led organizations and/or coalitions can play a key role in addressing.\n\nIllustrative strategic approaches for this objective may include, but are not limited to:\n\n-      Supporting the creation, translation, and/or dissemination of culturally appropriate and evidence-based content in local language(s) to proactively dispel the myths of anti-rights actors, educate on existence of pre-colonial diversity in SOGIESC, and recognize the contributions of LGBTQI+ people throughout history;\n\n-      Providing LGBTQI+ organizations and activists with sufficient knowledge and tools to monitor and report on harmful mis- and disinformation about LGBTQI+ issues (including so-called CTP,  reparative therapy,   unwanted same-sex attraction,  etc.) on traditional and social media platforms;\n\n-      Increasing the capacities of organizations to prevent and/or respond to and mitigate the harms of technology-facilitated GBV targeting LGBTQI+ persons;\n\n-      Establishing cross-sectoral coalitions and cross-movement solidarity to positively reframe and respond to threats emanating from anti-rights actors;\n\n-      Identifying and training journalists to take a rights-based approach to reporting on LGBTQI+-related issues and to identify and dispel mis- and dis-information when they see it.\"",

An additional incentive of $500 per port may be awarded for eligible Level 2 charging equipment installed at a workplace or MUD location within a DAC. Equipment Owners at workplace or MUD locations may choose to participate in a bonus program to receive additional incentives. Public and private (for-profit and not-for-profit) entities may participate in the Program. Applicants can be the Equipment Owners or the Installers on behalf of the Equipment Owners. Full program rules and procedures, additional information about the program, and current lists of eligible EV charging equipment and network providers can be found at [nyserda.ny.gov/Charge-Ready-NY](http://nyserda.ny.gov/Charge-Ready-NY).\n\n\n\n**Program Overview** \n\nThe Charge Ready NY 2.0 Program (Program) is an incentive program designed to accelerate the deployment of Level 2 electric vehicle charging equipment in New York State. By increasing the use of electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations, this program benefits New York State by reducing harmful emissions and the transportation sector's dependence on petroleum. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) developed the Program to provide incentives that reduce the cost of purchasing and installing eligible Level 2 charging equipment for use in New York State.\n\nNote to Applicants: This Implementation Manual (Manual), including the Equipment Owner Agreement, the Installer Agreement, and eligible charging equipment and network providers may be amended from time to time without notice, at NYSERDA s sole discretion. Pre-installation or post-installation applications must comply with the most current version of the Manual, including charging equipment and network providers eligibility, on the date the application is submitted to NYSERDA.\n\nThis document, including Appendix A, constitutes the Implementation Manual for the Program.\n\nDefinitions of key program parameters are in the Definitions section of the Manual.\n\nThe Program provides incentives that reduce the cost of purchasing and installing eligible Level 2\n\ncharging equipment installed within New York State that provide charging at a public facility within a Disadvantaged Community (DAC), workplace, or at a multi-unit dwelling (MUD) as defined below. Public and private (both for-profit and not-for-profit) entities may participate in the Program. NYSERDA intends to provide incentives of $4,000 per charging port installed at a public facility within a DAC, $2,000 per charging port installed at a workplace or MUD location, and $2,500 per charging port installed at a workplace or MUD location within a DAC. Incentives will be paid upon completion of the installation of the charging equipment and the provision of appropriate documentation. Charging stations in assigned parking spaces reserved for the exclusive use of an individual driver or reserved for fleet vehicles are eligible at a reduced incentive level, and certain larger workplace and multi-family dwellings are subject to additional requirements. Minimum and maximum charging ports per site are described in section 3;\n\nthe number of incentives awarded per site shall be at NYSERDA s discretion. Bonus incentives for workplace and MUD locations are also available as discussed in section 7.\n\nThe Program is offering $12 million in funding for incentives and will accept applications on an open-\n\nenrollment, first-come, first-served basis until December 31, 2025, or until the program runs out of funds, whichever comes first. An additional $3 million is available for the bonus incentives described in section 7.\n\nAdditional information about the program, current lists of eligible charging equipment and networks, and the current amount of funding remaining in the program can be found on NYSERDA s website, www.nyserda.ny.gov/charge-ready-ny. Charging equipment and network service eligibility rules are defined in section 2.1 of this Manual.\n\n\n\nThe Program allows Applicants to participate in one of two ways:\n\nPre-Installation Approval: Applicants can apply for pre-installation approval of an incentive payment. If the pre-installation approval application is granted, NYSERDA will reserve funds for the Applicant s incentive. However, the applicant must complete their installations and submit all required documentation to NYSERDA within one-hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the pre-installation approval date. Upon approval of all documentation (refer to section 6), NYSERDA will issue an incentive payment directly to the Applicant in the form of a paper check or by electronic payment.\n\nPost Installation Approval: Applicants can apply for an incentive payment after the installation is completed. The installation must be completed after the Program Effective Date. NYSERDA must receive the application within 90 days of the Installation Date. As part of their application, Applicants must submit all required documentation. Upon approval of all documentation, NYSERDA will issue an incentive payment directly to the Applicant in the form of a paper check or by electronic payment.\n\nImportant: Program requirements are determined by NYSERDA which, in its sole discretion reserves the right to make changes to Program elements such as, but not limited to, eligible equipment and networks, incentive amounts, and Applicant requirements.\"",

        "title": "\"New York Healthy Food",
        "description": " Healthy Lives: Supporting a More Equitable Food System\"The communities most affected by these disparities often have the best solutions to improving food equity. Generally, these organizations have not had access to or benefited from traditional philanthropic funds and resources.\n\n\n\nNYHealth is intentionally and explicitly increasing our efforts to improve racial health equity. Through this RFP, NYHealth aims to advance racial health equity through two strategies of our [Healthy Food, Healthy Lives](https://nyhealthfoundation.org/what-we-fund/healthy-food-healthy-lives/) program: **(1) promoting Food Is Medicine interventions** and **(2) supporting** **healthier, culturally responsive food purchasing.** We seek to support organizations led by and supporting communities of color to implement community-driven projects informed by and responsive to community needs.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\nAccess to and consumption of nutritious food is essential to maintaining good health. Nutritious food can help prevent disease and can act as medicine, supporting healthy growth and development. NYHealth's Healthy Food, Healthy Lives priority area aims to advance policies and programs that connect New Yorkers with the food they need to thrive.\n\nFood security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. However, stark racial and ethnic disparities are well-documented; there are disproportionately high rates of food insecurity and diet-related disease in communities of color.\n\nAnd a food system characterized by systemic racism, racial and ethnic biases, and inequities contributes substantially to these disparities. Whether termed food apartheid, food swamps, or food deserts, neighborhood food environments, institutional practices, and resulting unequal access to healthy, affordable food undermine New Yorkers  health. As examples: \n\n -      According to a recent U.S. Census survey, Asian, Black, and Hispanic New Yorkers were up to three times more likely than white New Yorkers to report \"sometimes\" or  often  not having enough food;\n\n-      NYHealth s Food and Health Survey found that Asian, Black, and Hispanic food-insecure New Yorkers are more likely than their white peers to face difficulty affording food and traveling to the grocery store;\n\n-      According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African Americans are twice as likely to die from heart disease and 50% more likely to have high blood pressure than whites;\n\n-      Nationally, one out of every five Black households is located in a food desert.  Supermarket redlining \n\n-    in Black communities means that residents in these communities have less access to full-service grocery stores;\n\n-      Producers and farmers of color face obstacles that make it harder for them to compete for contracts with institutions; and\n\n-      Communities of color are targeted with high levels of unhealthy food marketing.\n\nThe communities most affected by these disparities often have the best solutions to improving food equity. However, systemic barriers often exist, and historically, organizations led by people of color have not had equal access to or benefited from traditional philanthropy funds and resources.\n\nFUNDING OPPORTUNITY \n\nNYHealth is intentionally and explicitly increasing our efforts to improve racial health equity. We seek to support organizations led by and supporting communities of color to implement projects that are informed by and responsive to community needs.\n\nThrough this Request for Proposals (RFP), NYHealth aims to advance racial health equity through two of our Healthy Food, Healthy Lives strategies: (1) promoting Food Is Medicine interventions and (2) supporting healthier, culturally responsive food purchasing.\n\n1) Promoting Food Is Medicine interventions: Interventions that involve a health care response to the need for better nutrition fall under the umbrella term Food Is Medicine. Interventions include programs such as medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, and produce prescription programs.\n\n\n\nExamples of these types of projects that NYHealth might support through this RFP include, but are not limited to, those that:\n\n-      Co-design Food Is Medicine programs with community-based organizations and/or health care providers so that programs center residents and reflect the needs and preferences of the communities served.\n\n-      Work with community health centers to solicit feedback from Food Is Medicine participants to improve services (e.g., cultural responsiveness, screening).\n\n-      Create partnerships between health care providers and local farmers/urban farms to support the expansion of specific Food Is Medicine interventions like produce prescription programs.\n\n-      Mobilize community members to advocate for access to or expansion of Food Is Medicine programs at a community-based organization and/or health care provider.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-DA-24-040  \n**URPOSE**\n\n\n\nThis Brain-Behavior Quantification and Synchronization (BBQS) notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) seeks applications that bring together transdisciplinary teams and aim to 1) develop, validate, and apply cutting-edge tools and methods for minimally invasive, multi-dimensional, high-resolution objective measurement of behavior at the organismal level, with synchronous capture of dynamic environmental data; 2) develop advanced analytic approaches to integrate multidimensional behavioral, neural and environmental data; and 3) develop and test new theoretical and computational models aiming to advance understanding of behavior as a complex dynamic system. Proposed projects are expected to be designed with the capacity to integrate synchronously recorded neural data and/or inform existing models of neurobehavioral function, such as those developed with the support of the NIH BRAIN Initiative.  \n\n\n\nThis BRAIN Initiative NOFO is soliciting applications either proposing basic research involving human subjects, observational studies or secondary data analysis, that aims to reveal and understand fundamental principles underlying behavioral function. Applications proposing research using exclusively non-human animal models should apply under the companion NOFO, [RFA-DA-24-041](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DA-24-041.html). Research proposals focused on specific diseases or disorders are not permitted under this NOFO.\n\n\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n\n\n**The NIH BRAIN Initiative**\n\n\n\nSince 2014, the [Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) has aimed to accelerate the development and application of innovative neurotechnologies, enabling researchers to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that reveals how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. It is expected that these advances will ultimately lead to new ways to treat and prevent brain disorders.\n\n\n\nAs one of several federal agencies involved in the BRAIN Initiative, NIH's contributions to the BRAIN Initiative were initially guided by \"[BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-2025-scientific-vision),\" a strategic plan that detailed seven high-priority research areas. This plan was updated and enhanced in 2019 by: \"[The BRAIN Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-20-report-cells-circuits-toward-cures)\" and \"[The BRAIN Initiative and Neuroethics: Enabling and Enhancing Neuroscience Advances for Society](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-20-neuroethics-enabling-and-enhancing-neuroscience).\" This and other BRAIN Initiative notices of funding opportunity (NOFOs) are based on this vision and issued with input from Advisory Councils of the [10 NIH Institutes and Centers supporting the BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/brain-partners), as assisted by the [NIH BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group).\n\n\n\nThe NIH BRAIN Initiative recognizes that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust.\n\n\n\nTo support the best science, the NIH BRAIN Initiative encourages inclusivity in research. Examples of structures that promote diverse perspectives include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  Transdisciplinary research projects and collaborations among neuroscientists and researchers from fields such as computational biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, computer and data sciences, as well as bioethics.\n\n-  Engagement from different types of institutions and organizations (e.g., research-intensive, undergraduate-focused, minority-serving, community-based).\n\n-  Individual applications and partnerships that enhance geographic and regional heterogeneity.\n\n-  Investigators and teams composed of researchers at different career stages.\n\n-  Participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups historically underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce (see [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html) and [https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives-pedp](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives-pedp)).\n\n-  Project-based opportunities to enhance the research environment to benefit early- and mid-career investigators.\n\n\n\nThe NIH also encourages businesses to participate in the BRAIN Initiative. It is possible for companies to submit applications directly to BRAIN Initiative program announcements or to collaborate with academic researchers in joint submissions.

It is expected that BRAIN Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings and in other activities such as the annual [BRAIN Initiative Conference](https://www.braininitiative.org/events/brainconference/). The data and resource sharing expectations for BRAIN Initiative awards can be found at [NOT-MH-19-010](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-19-010.html).\n\n\n\n**BBQS Funding Opportunities**\n\n\n\nThe two BRAIN Initiative 2.0 reports (\"[The BRAIN Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-20-report-cells-circuits-toward-cures)\" and \"[The BRAIN Initiative and Neuroethics: Enabling and Enhancing Neuroscience Advances for Society](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-20-neuroethics-enabling-and-enhancing-neuroscience)\") highlight that a critical step forward is to study \"the brain in action,\" including efforts to develop \"tools to analyze naturalistic (untrained) and trained behaviors\" and \"to assimilate and link brain recordings with behavior\" (p. 34 of \"[The BRAIN Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/nih-brain-initiative-reports/brain-20-report-cells-circuits-toward-cures)\"). Matching the [scientific rigor](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#ScientificRigor) and precision of measurements of brain activity with equally precise, temporally dense measurements of the functional output of the brain, as expressed in a broad range of behaviors, will accelerate the discovery of brain-behavior relationships in both health and disease. Achieving a comprehensive understanding across these levels of analysis demands the same level of rigor, precision of measurement, and temporal resolution across all levels.\n\n\n\nAt present, tools for measuring behavior in humans and other species lack the necessary precision and resolution to fully capture behavioral dynamics synchronously with data from the environment with which the organism is interacting and which shapes the behavior under study. To address this gap, the BRAIN Initiative BBQS funding opportunities support 1) development of tools for simultaneous, multimodal measurement of behavior within complex, dynamic physical and/or social environments and align these data with simultaneously recorded neural activity; and 2) development of novel conceptual and computational models that capture dynamic behavior-environment relationships across multiple timescales and that can integrate correlated neural activity into the model. Information on BRAIN BBQS Funding Opportunities can be found at the [BRAIN Initiative Notices of Funding Opportunities webpage](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/funding-opportunities) (select \"BBQS\" in the Filter column) or by contacting BBQS at [BRAINBBQS@od.nih.gov](mailto:BRAINBBQS@od.nih.gov).\n\n\n\n**BBQS Transformative and Integrative Models of Behavior at the Organismal Level**\n\n\n\nBehavior, i.e., how organisms, including humans, interact with their environments, is a critical determinant of health and a mediator of morbidity for nearly all diseases. To fully understand behavior as a determinant of health and disease, it is necessary not only to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying behavior but also to understand how behavior and its underlying mechanisms are shaped by their adaptive significance to the development of the individual and to the evolution of the relevant population/species. Moreover, an understanding of how brain-body-behavior relationships are conserved or divergent across species is critical for the rigorous use of non-human species to model aspects of human neurobehavioral function in health and disease.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this NIH BRAIN Initiative BBQS funding opportunity is to support the design of research that will advance behavioral science through: 1) Integration of theoretical frameworks guiding the study of behavior, its underlying mechanisms, and adaptive value; 2) Early or exploratory application of technologies and methods for objective, high-resolution measurement of behavior at the level of the organism and its/their environment; 3) Development of sharable standards and archives for behavioral data; and 4) Development of new computational models that capture the behavior-environment interface as a complex dynamic system.\n\n\n\n**RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE**\n\n\n\nThe goal of this funding opportunity is to support research having the following **major objectives**:\n\n\n\n1.  To engage an interdisciplinary and functionally diverse team including scientists from diverse fields across the behavioral and social sciences, engineers, ethicists, and others with diverse experiences and perspectives that will work to develop innovative, transdisciplinary approaches for measuring and modeling human behavior at the organismal level in the context of complex, dynamic social and physical environments; \n\n2.  To develop or advance non-invasive, minimally intrusive approaches for synchronous measurement of multiple behavioral, physiological and environmental variables that capture behavior as a multidimensional, organismal process; and\n\n3.  To develop a predictive or testable statistical/computational model (including machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) methods) designed to integrate multidimensional behavioral and environmental data. Such models would be expected to be built with the capacity to integrate simultaneously collected neural data.\n\n\n\n***The following additional requirements apply to this RFA***: \n\n\n\n-  The team of Investigators must include substantial expertise in ethics.\n\n-  The Research Strategy must address ethical challenges that may emerge with the use of the proposed technology and methodology for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and otherwise using human subject-level data. \n\n-  Applications can propose basic behavioral research involving human subjects. While inclusion of subjects with diagnoses of psychiatric or neurologic conditions may be part of a strategy to study a range of neurobehavioral function, the purpose of the proposed research must relate to advancing knowledge on the fundamental principles underlying neurobehavioral function in complex environments. This NOFO is not intended to stimulate research focused on specific diseases or disorders.\n\n\n\nIn consideration of the purpose of this RFA, applicants are informed that **all applications must address the major objectives and additional requirements** described above in this \"Research Objectives and Scope\" subsection. Applications that do not address these objectives and requirements will be withdrawn. \n\n\n\n**Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives**\n\n\n\n-  This NOFO requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) as described in [NOT-MH-21-310](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-21-310.html), submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV).\n\n-  Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the NOFO instructions carefully and view the available [PEDP guidance material](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/vision/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives). The PEDP will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation, as well as considered among programmatic matters with respect to funding decisions.\n\n\n\n**Research topics and activities of interest under this RFA include, but are not limited to, the following:**\n\n\n\n-  ***Development, novel application or advancement of methodologies or technologies including:***\n\n    -  Hardware and/or software tools that advance novel methods to simultaneously capture and quantify multiple observable dimensions of behavior including, but not limited to, whole-body ambulation;

and synchronization and integration of multidimensional behavioral and environmental data. \n\n    -  Analytic tools and statistical and/or computational approaches (e.g., ML/AI methods) with the capacity to integrate multidimensional behavioral and environmental data, and to capture processes occurring across a wide range of timescales (e.g., milliseconds to days) and modalities.\n\n    -  Use of existing data and/or synthetic data to validate or assess feasibility of sensor methodology and/or computational models based on the integration of multidimensional behavioral and environmental data.\n\n    -  Approaches that integrate multidimensional behavioral and/or environmental data with synchronous measures of neural activity.\n\n-  ***Development and testing new theoretical frameworks informed by multiple disciplines within the behavioral, neural, and social sciences, including but not limited to:***\n\n    -  New approaches to modeling the subject's physiology, behavior and environment as a complex dynamic system.\n\n    -  Novel conceptual and computational frameworks that test hypotheses about specific cognitive processes as mediators or moderators of complex, integrated behavioral and physiological responses as the subject responds to her/his/their social or physical environment.\n\n    -  Studies examining how cognitive function (e.g. decision-making) may change as a function of the complexity of, or constraints on, the behavior of the subject, using methods that capture multiple dimensions of an integrated organismal behavioral response. \n\n    -  Research examining the influences of evolutionary processes on relationships between cognitive function and behavior at the organismal level.\n\n    -  Studies designed to use real-time, multimodal behavioral and environmental sensing, and computational modeling, to test potentially competing or orthogonal theories about one or a set of related behavioral or cognitive processes.\n\n    -  Research examining neurocognitive and behavioral diversity across individuals or within an organism as a function of the complexity of the physical or social environment. \n\n    -  Studies that examine how relationships between cognitive function and the complexity and kinetics of behavior at the organismal level change across neurodevelopment.\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO**\n\n\n\nThe following will be deemed \"not responsive\" and will be returned without review:\n\n\n\n-  Applications that fail to address the three major objectives described above under the \"Research Objectives and Scope\" sub-section.\n\n-  Applications that fail to include in the Research Plan consideration of ethical challenges that may emerge with the use of the proposed technology and methodology for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and otherwise using individual-level participant data.\n\n-  Applications proposing exclusively studies in which behavior is highly restricted (e.g., experiments requiring head or body restraint) or in which a highly trained or stereotyped response (e.g., isolated arm or eye movement) is used solely as an assay of a cognitive process.\n\n-  Applications proposing research aimed exclusively at studying or modeling neurobehavioral disorders or disease.\n\n\n\n***Prior Consultation with IC staff***\n\n\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed in Section VII to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the goals of this NOFO and the BRAIN Initiative Program.\n\n\n\n**Resource Sharing**\n\n\n\nA major goal of the BRAIN initiative is to support the collaborative development and dissemination of resources. Applications are expected to provide a Resource Sharing Plan that outlines how the deliverables from the proposed project, except for data, will be shared and disseminated. Resources to address in the Resource Sharing Plan include algorithms, formal theories, models, methods/protocols, software, technology, etc.. Awardees will be required to participate in post-award activities (e.g., BRAIN Initiative investigator meetings) designed to increase sharing of resources, data, protocols, and other information. Project-specific details will be established at the time of award.\n\n\n\nData sharing is addressed in a separate Data Management and Sharing Plan in compliance with the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy. See **Section IV.2 - Other Plans**, below. \n\n\n\n**Special Considerations**\n\n\n\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the [Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&reserved=0).

        "title": "\"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Genetic Underpinnings of Endosomal Trafficking as a Pathological Hub in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD)\"",
        "description": "\"Notice Number: NOT-AG-21-034  \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is defined, in part, by the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits. Supported by genetic studies, the amyloid cascade is a leading hypothesis for the cause and pathogenesis of AD. Despite the intensive efforts that have been made in understanding amyloid and other pathological processes in AD, current approved interventions for AD have shown only modest effects in modifying clinical symptoms; none have been efficacious for slowing disease progression as demonstrated through clinical outcome measures.\n\n\n\nRecent developments in the field of genetics have significantly advanced understanding of the etiology of AD; more than two dozen genes are now known to be associated with late-onset AD (LOAD). Using a combination of genome wide association studies (GWAS), exome chips, imputation, whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome sequencing (WGS), a number of AD genetic \"hubs\" have recently begun to emerge that may explain some of the bases for the development of the disease. These hubs include the well-known amyloid precursor processing (APP) pathway and the less understood genetic and genomic events associated with cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation and cellular immunity, and endocytosis pathways. Known genes that appear to be directly or indirectly associated with the endosomal compartment include APOEe4, SORL1, BIN1, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP. Some genes are observed in more than one pathway, leaving open the possibility that individuals with multiply affected pathways may be more vulnerable to the pathophysiology associated with AD.\n\n\n\nA newly emerging model proposes that alterations in the way the cellular endosomal compartment processes amyloid precursor protein (APP) may represent a pathogenic hub for AD. This model suggests that therapies directed against extracellular amyloid plaques may fail because they are being administered too late in the disease process. Many AD genes directly or indirectly converge upon the endosomal genetic hub. Thus, the hub may act as a common pathway through which many downstream pathophysiological effects can be mediated. In-depth assessment of the genetic components related to the endosomal cellular trafficking pathway may help direct the research community toward novel alternative biological targets for therapeutic interventions.\n\n\n\nThe goals of this Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) are to encourage basic and translational research focused on the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes associated with the endosomal compartment in AD and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). Studies funded under this topic will support research into AD/ADRD pathogenesis related to enhancing our understanding of how the genetic underpinnings of endosomal trafficking in AD/ADRD may act as a hub in the pathophysiological changes associated with the disease. The impact of changes in endosomal genetics on functional events, for example upon the generation of amyloid Beta (A ) cellular processing, are important factors to be evaluated. This includes both the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways. All phases of endosomal processing during early through late processing stages are of interest, including those genes/events that may affect the cell membrane; early, mature, and late endosomes; the retromer/recycling pathway; the retrograde pathway/trans-Golgi network; the lysosome, endolysosome, and multi-vesicular body; receptors related to cellular trafficking and cell sorting; and other related cell processing components. Applications that delineate cellular gene ontology networks and determine the weight of their impact upon endosomal processing are of interest. Applications that apply Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning methods to data analysis approaches in this area are welcome. Data generated under this NOSI will be shared through the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site ([NIAGADS](https://www.niagads.org/)) and/or another NIA-approved storage site.\n\n\n\nAreas of research interest and opportunity that would be considered high priority under this topic include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n  - Improved characterization (in vivo/in vitro) of the functions of known endosomal genes and their impact upon AD/ADRD pathophysiology.\n\n  - Identification and characterization of novel genes not presently known to be associated with the endosomal compartment.\n\n  - Analysis of existing whole genome and whole exome sequence data, such as that generated by the [Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP)](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dn/alzheimers-disease-sequencing-project-study-design) to identify genetic variants and their function in known and novel endosomal genes.\n\n  - Determination of the impact of changes in endosomal genetics on functional events (amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic) in cellular trafficking in AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Definition and characterization of the relationship between genes associated with AD/ADRD and endosomal processing in specific neural cell populations; this includes neurons (soma, axonal, and/or dendritic) and glia.\n\n  - Characterization of cell types affected by changes in endosomal processing by physiological measures such as changes in neural activity.\n\n  - Identification and characterization of the impact of genes and networks of genes that are outside of the endosomal pathway to determine their links to endosomal trafficking in AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Delineation of cellular gene ontology networks related to endosomal processing and determination of the weight of their impact upon endosomal processing and pathophysiology.\n\n  - Identification of cellular networks and brain regions that are selectively vulnerable to changes in endosomal processing in AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Improvement of our understanding of how clusters of genes in the endosomal pathway may change endosomal trafficking resulting in pathological events in AD/ADRD; this includes a better understanding of how genes that act in more than one pathway impact endosomal processing, and a better understanding of converging and cascading pathways related to the endosomal compartment and how they may impact AD/ADRD pathophysiology.\n\n  - Analysis of in vivo and in vitro outcomes of interventions that are directly designed to increase traffic flow through the endosomal compartment and may serve as models for therapeutic approaches in AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Identification of novel therapeutic targets associated with the endosomal compartment using existing and new *in vivo* and/or *in vitro* approaches.\n\n  - Improvement of our understanding of how known and newly identified protective variants associated with the endosomal compartment may be leveraged into therapeutic targets for AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Determination of whether the amyloid hypothesis, when seen through the lens of genetic changes in endosomal processing, can aid in the identification of useful therapeutic targets that can be applied at the earliest possible stage in the disease process.\n\n  - Determination of whether/how the endosomal compartment may act as a common pathway through which downstream pathophysiological events in AD/ADRD can be mediated.\n\n  - Comprehensive analysis of how single-cell transcriptomic (e.g., RNAseq), epigenetic (e.g., chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation), and/or genomic (e.g., sequencing for mutations) events impact neurons and glial cells and are related to changes in the endosomal compartment.\n\n  - Novel multidisciplinary technological approaches to assess changes in the endosomal compartment in AD/ADRD.\n\n  - Analysis of trans-synaptic spread (e.g., by exosomes) in AD/ADRD that may be mediated by genetically modulated changes in endosomal trafficking.\n\n\n\nApplications proposing clinical trials on this topic would not be considered a high priority.\"",

        "title": "\"IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) (P20 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-23-100  \n**Background**  \n\n\n\nAuthorized by the U.S. Congress in 1993, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program to build biomedical research capacity in the [23 U.S. states and Puerto Rico](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/DRCB/IDeA/Pages/default.aspx) that had historically low NIH grant funding success rates. IDeA funding programs collectively support biomedical research in basic, clinical, behavioral, and translational science in IDeA-eligible states and Puerto Rico by developing faculty investigators, providing research opportunities to students, and enhancing research infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program is a key IDeA component that funds one statewide network of higher education and research institutions in each IDeA-eligible state and Puerto Rico to build biomedical research capacity through supporting faculty research and research mentoring, student participation in research, and research infrastructure enhancement at network institutions. These networks aim to catalyze, develop, and strengthen research culture at network institutions, support faculty for research excellence, and provide students with research opportunities to help develop a strong biomedical research workforce.\n\n\n\n****Program Description and Requirements****  \n\n\n\n**Overall Plan:** An INBRE Network is comprised of higher education and research institutions in an IDeA state. The lead institution of this multi-institutional network should have a broad and strong biomedical research base to lead the research and capacity building activities of the Network, as well as well-established research administration infrastructure that can effectively administer the multi-component INBRE award with sub-awards to network institutions. Primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), including four-year colleges, two-year colleges, and minority-serving institutions with degree programs related to biomedical research, are the intended principal participants of the Network. Sixty percent of the INBRE budget must be devoted to supporting the PUIs, their faculty and students. Institutions in the state that receive Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and IDeA Networks for Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR) awards must participate in the Network and make their research resources accessible to students and faculty of the INBRE Network. Other higher education and biomedical research institutions are also eligible to join the Network. INBREs are encouraged to collaborate with the NIH-supported Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) programs in IDeA states to engage pre-college students in biomedical research. An INBRE must develop an evaluation plan to monitor and evaluate the performance and impact of the award.\n\n\n\nThe Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) of an INBRE award assumes overall scientific and administrative leadership of the Network. The PD/PI must be an established biomedical researcher holding a full-time appointment at the lead institution and with a record of successful administrative and mentoring experiences. Multi-PD/PI (MPI) applications are allowed, and a PD/PI succession plan is encouraged. A Steering Committee (SC) comprised of the PD(s)/PI(s) and one senior institutional leader (Vice President/President or equivalent) from each network institution ensures the Network's adherence to INBRE's mission in building research capacity statewide, and each network institution's support of their faculty and students' participation in INBRE activities. An Executive Committee (EC) comprised of the PD(s)/PI(s), one faculty lead from each network institution, and other key personnel appointed by the PDs/PIs, assists the PD(s)/PI(s) in administering the award. An External Advisory Committee (EAC) of experts provide advice on critical scientific activities and administrative decisions. (See Section IV for Composition and Responsibilities of each Committee).\n\n\n\nRequired components of the Network include an Administrative Core (AC) that also manages a Student Research Program that supports undergraduate students' participation in research in addition to other administrative responsibilities for the Network, a Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP), and a Data Science Core (DSC). Optional components include Research Cores and Alteration and Renovation Projects. All proposed components must be integral to attaining the goals of the Network and are expected to interact with each other and with relevant existing programs in the state to foster a collaborative research environment.\n\n\n\n**Administrative Core (required):** The Administrative Core (AC) administers the INBRE award. It is led by the PD(s)/PI(s) and may include a Program Coordinator (PC) as well as staff essential for administering the award. Responsibilities of the AC include:\n\n\n\n-  Preparing accurate and timely program and financial reports;\n\n-  Ensuring all network activities are in compliance with federal regulations and requirements;\n\n-  Managing the Network's budget;\n\n-  Coordinating activities of all components and committees of the Network; and\n\n-  Conducting evaluation of the INBRE award.\n\n\n\nThe AC manages a Student Research Program (SRP) that supports undergraduate student participation in mentored research during the summer break and/or academic semesters. Students in all fields of study enrolled in network institutions may apply for SRP support. INBREs of states with fewer than four accredited higher education institutions that award degrees in biomedical sciences may expand the SRP eligibility to high school students. Faculty investigators conducting research in all biomedical fields in network institutions of the INBRE, including PDs/PIs of IDeA awards, may serve as preceptors for SRP-supported students. Information about the SRP, including eligibility criteria for student participants and faculty preceptors, levels of support to be provided, the application and selection process, methods for matching students with preceptors, expectations for the students and matrix for evaluating their research experience, expectations for the preceptors and matrix for evaluating their research experience, and roles and contact information of individuals managing SRP at the AC and each network institution, must be disseminated to students and faculty of network institutions.\n\n\n\nThe AC should organize a network-wide annual research conference. SRP-supported students should be given opportunities to present their research outcomes and share their experience at the conference.\n\n\n\nThe AC may sponsor research, career enhancement and mentoring activities for faculty and students, such as lecture and seminar series, grantsmanship and scientific presentation workshops, career counseling, and graduate school application workshops. The AC may also support faculty efforts to incorporate research into the science curricula at PUIs and provide financial support to help PUIs to recruit faculty in biomedical sciences.\n\n\n\n**Developmental Research Project Program (required):** An INBRE Network must support a Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) led by an established scientist with experience in mentoring and applying for external research funding. If the DRPP funds projects involving human subjects including clinical trials, the lead of the DRPP assumes the oversight responsibilities of these studies. The DRPP administers grants to faculty investigators at network institutions supporting Research Projects (RPs) and/or Pilot Projects (PPs). A RP may be funded for up to two years with direct costs up to $125,000 per year. Six person months effort is required of a RP leader. A PP may be funded for one year with direct costs up to $50,000. Three person months effort is required of a PP leader. These awards are renewable. Student participation is strongly encouraged for all DRPP-funded research. Information about the DRPP including applicant eligibility criteria, the application, review, and selection process, expectations for RP and PP leaders and matrix for evaluation, and roles and contact information of individuals managing SRP must be disseminated through the network.\n\n\n\n**Data Science Core (required)**: Each INBRE must support a Data Science Core (DSC) to provide faculty and students access to data science resources, services and training needed for biomedical research. The DSC is expected to develop data science expertise including scientific programing, data analysis, data management, data security, and access to big data and cloud computing for biomedical research to meet the needs of faculty and students throughout the Network. The DSC should encourage and facilitate utilization of biomedical data repositories and knowledge bases in INBRE-supported research. The DSC is expected to provide training and/or introduce training opportunities to faculty and students in emerging data science disciplines such as machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Collaborations across other INBRE Data Science Cores for sharing training and research resources are strongly encouraged.\n\n\n\n**Research Core(s) (optional):** An INBRE may support Research Cores if a broad user base for such cores among faculty and students in the Network is anticipated. A Research Core should be accessible to all faculty and students in the Network and should not duplicate services available through facilities that already exist within the Network, or that are supported by other IDeA programs, e.g., IDeA-CTR and COBRE(s) in the state.\n\n\n\n**Alteration and Renovation Projects (optional):** Alteration and Renovation (A&R) projects at PUIs to improve existing research laboratories or animal facilities that will be used broadly by students and faculty in the Network are allowed. More than one A&R project may be proposed as long as the costs do not exceed the allowed budget cap.\n\n\n\n**NIH/NIGMS Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) (Required):**\n\n\n\nNIGMS recognizes that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust.\n\n\n\nTo support the best science, NIGMS encourages inclusivity in research. Examples of structures that promote diverse perspectives include but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  Transdisciplinary research projects and collaborations among network institutions in all biomedical research areas, including fields such as computational biology, physics, engineering, mathematics, computer and data sciences, as well as bioethics.\n\n-  Engagement from different types of institutions and organizations in the state (e.g., research-intensive, undergraduate-focused, minority-serving, community-based).\n\n-  Individual applications and partnerships that enhance geographic and regional heterogeneity.\n\n-  Investigators and teams composed of researchers at different career stages.\n\n-  Participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including groups traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce (see [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)), such as underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women.\n\n-  Project-based opportunities to enhance the research environment to benefit early- and mid-career investigators.\n\n\n\nThis FOA requires a PEDP as part of the application (see Section IV.2 SF424(R&R) Other Project Information. Other Attachments). Accordingly, the examples listed above may be included, if they are appropriate for the goals and requirements of the INBRE program. For further information on the PEDP, please see [https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/pedp-key-elements-and-examples](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/pedp-key-elements-and-examples).\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\"",

Kayal is a leading scholar on Arab American studies and currently a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. He is passionate about supporting Arab American students entering the social science fields. Dr. Kayal's parents were immigrants from Aleppo, Syria and were not part of the emerging entrepreneurial Syrian elite class. His family could not afford college for Philip and his brother, who were both accepted at Fordham University, a private Jesuit school. Philip received financial support from both the Risq Haddad Foundation and the Aleppian Charities Fraternity, allowing him to pursue his educational goals. He would like to pay this generosity forward to the next generation of talented students.\n\n\n\n**ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP**\n\nThe Kayal Scholarship for Arab American Students in the Social Sciences supports exceptionally driven and talented Arab American/MENA students studying a social science, with preference to students being the first in their family to attend college. It is anticipated that scholarships will be $1,000-$2,500 per student and may be renewable for up to four years for students who meet the University s satisfactory academic progress standards for scholarships. The fund will make all grant distributions directly to the student s affiliated college or university. All colleges and universities must be accredited.\"",

We believe there are many more life-saving open source technologies in the world.\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 Solutions Fund, we will accept applications that are hardware (e.g., an open source ventilator), software (e.g., a platform that connects hospitals with people who have 3D printers who can print parts for that open source ventilator), as well as software that solves for secondary effects of COVID-19 (e.g., a browser plugin that combats COVID related misinformation).\n\nA few key details of the program:\n\n \tWe are generally looking to fund reasonably mature projects that can immediately deploy our funding, early stage ideas are unlikely to receive funding.\n\n \tWe generally expect awardees to use all funds within three months of receiving the award.\n\n \tWe will accept applications from anywhere in the world to the extent legally permitted.\n\n \tWe will accept applications from any type of legal entity, including NGOs, for profit hospitals, or a team of developers with strong ties to an affected community.\n\n \tApplications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n \tThe MOSS committee will only consider projects which are released publicly under a license that is either a free software license according to the FSF or an open source license according to the OSI. Projects which are not licensed for use under an open source license are not eligible for MOSS funding.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the MOSS program, please visit: Mozilla.org/moss.\n\n\n\nABOUT MOSS\n\n\n\nThe Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) awards program, created in 2015, broadens access, increases security, and empowers users by providing catalytic funding to open source technologists. In addition to the COVID-19 Solutions Fund, MOSS has three tracks:\n\n\n\nTrack I - Foundational Technology: supports open source projects that Mozilla relies on, either as an embedded part of our products or as part of our everyday work.\n\nTrack II - Mission Partners: supports open source projects that significantly advance Mozilla's mission.\n\nTrack III - The Secure Open Source Fund: supports security audits for widely used open source software projects as well as any work needed to fix the problems that are found.\"",

        "title": "\"Health Foundation for Western and Central New York - Older Adults\"",
        "description": "\"Wondering how your organization can get grant funding? We receive a majority of requests for funding through programs we design with input from our local communities. But because we value hearing from and being responsive to our community partners outside of this processWe are not currently accepting unsolicited requests for funding or letters of intent, but we remain dedicated to working with community-based organizations in western and central New York.  Please see the \"Inquire About Funding\" section of this page to learn more.\n\n\n\nDuring the periods we accept unsolicited requests, there are some basic guidelines to keep in mind as you prepare your proposal. Namely, your project should be in line with the Foundation's mission, vision and values, and support one or more of our three focus areas:\n\n\n\nOlder Adults\n\nYoung Children Impacted by Poverty\n\nCommunity Health Capacity\n\nOnce received, our team will thoroughly review your request for funding to support your project.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, submitting a grant request does not guarantee funding.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOlder Adults\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, submitting a grant request does not guarantee funding.\n\n\n\nAll older adults lead a dignified, independent, high quality life in their community.\n\nBy 2030, 70 million Americans - that's one in five - will be over the age of 65. And according to AARP, 87% of adults 65 and over want to stay in their current home as they get older.\n\n\n\nHowever, our health care system offers older adults limited options for receiving care in the community, especially for those with low incomes or living in rural areas. And older adults face the risk of events, such as falls, or health changes that can lead to frailty, limit their daily activities and result in a loss of independence.\n\n\n\nWe call these events triggers of decline, and they are more than the risks older adults face individually, like poor mobility, malnutrition or chronic illnesses. They can also be shaped by challenges in the family or community, such as weak social networks and caregiver stress, and at the societal level with issues like lack of transportation and medication mismanagement. These triggers can occur suddenly or they can build over time, and they often overlap and compound one another.\n\nBy focusing on interventions around the triggers of decline, our goal is to improve the quality of care for older adults and prevent the onset of frailty.\n\n\n\nThrough our work with our community partners, we want to help older adults stay healthy and independent in their homes and communities as they age.\n\nChallenge: Falls and frailty: One out of every three people over 65 will fall each year, resulting in loss of independence. In fact, falling is a top reason older adults are moved to institutional care. Many falls occur at or close to home, and are preventable.\n\nChallenge: Caregiver stress: When you're a caregiver, the demands can be overwhelming. Caregivers report that the stress of caregiving affects their physical and emotional health, finances, and their jobs.\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIES\n\n\n\nPrevent Falls\n\n\n\nSince 2007, we've invested nearly $3 million to prevent falls, and we're currently developing new ways to address one of the most critical, and most preventable, triggers of decline.\n\nView Programs\n\nhttps://hfwcny.org/program/strategy/prevent-falls/\n\n\n\nSupport Caregivers\n\n\n\nProving support to caregivers is essential, so we're committed to finding the most effective ways to help caregivers take care of themselves and those they care for.\n\nView Programs\n\nhttps://hfwcny.org/program/strategy/supporting-caregivers/\n\n\n\nPROGRAMS\n\n\n\nBelow are our programs related to older adults\n\nAGING BY DESIGN\n\nhttps://hfwcny.org/program/aging-by-design/\n\n\n\nSUPPORTING CAREGIVERS\n\nhttps://hfwcny.org/program/supporting-caregivers/\n\n\n\nSTEP UP TO STOP FALLS\n\nhttps://hfwcny.org/program/step-stop-falls/\n\n\n\nOUTCOMES\n\n\n\nFewer Trips to the Hospital Due to a Fall\n\n\n\nIn counties that participated in Step Up to Stop Falls, the rate of hospitalization from unintentional falls went from an average of 2,108 per 100,000 residents to 1,762 from 2005 to 2013. The rate across New York State for the same time period stayed roughly the same.\n\n\n\nCaregivers Take Care of Themselves and Those They Care For\n\n\n\nThrough Powerful Tools for Caregivers, caregivers learned how to manage stress and connect with services. We're currently developing new programs that will meet the needs of caregivers in our regions.\"",

        "title": "\"Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: NSF 23-530  \n**Synopsis**  \n\n\n\nDMREF seeks to foster the design, discovery, and development of materials to accelerate their path to deployment by harnessing the power of data and computational tools in concert with experiment and theory. DMREF emphasizes a deep integration of experiments, computation, and theory; the use of accessible digital data across the materials development continuum; and strengthening connections among theorists, computational scientists (including data scientists), and experimentalists as well as those from academia, industry, and government. DMREF is committed to the education and training of a next-generation materials research and development (R&D) workforce that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive; well-equipped for successful careers as educators and innovators; and able to take full advantage of the materials development continuum and innovation infrastructures that NSF is creating with partners in other federal agencies.\n\n\n\nDMREF is the principal NSF program responsive to the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC's) Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Subcommittee on the [Materials Genome Initiative (MGI)](https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/materials_genome_initiative-final.pdf). Over its inaugural decade, the MGI has driven a transformational paradigm shift in the philosophy of how materials research is performed. DMREF is supportive of the 2021 [MGI Strategic Plan](https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/MGI-2021-Strategic-Plan.pdf) and its three primary goals, *i.e.*, unifying the materials innovation infrastructure; harnessing the power of materials data; and educating, training, and connecting a world-class materials R&D workforce. \n\n\n\nDMREF will accordingly support activities that significantly accelerate the materials discovery-to-use timeline by building the fundamental knowledge base needed to advance the design, development, or manufacturability (*i.e.*, properties relevant to manufacturing, process-property relationships, property performance metrics, potential pathways for scale-up, economic feasibility, supply chain considerations, or life cycle issues) of materials with desirable properties or functionality. The 2021 [MGI Strategic Plan](https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/MGI-2021-Strategic-Plan.pdf) re-envisioned the linear Materials Development Continuum described in the original Strategic Plan to promote integration and iteration of knowledge across the entire path to deployment. DMREF will undertake this challenge through building a vibrant research community, forming interdisciplinary teams to conduct research in a \"closed-loop\" fashion, leveraging data science and machine learning, providing ready access to materials data, and educating the future MGI workforce.\n\n\n\nThis solicitation is open to all materials research topics. DMREF reflects the Administration's priorities for strengthening American leadership in technologies and industries of the future that are critical to the nation's health, economic prosperity, national security, and scientific enterprise. DMREF aligns with emerging technologies including [artificial intelligence](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1604756), [quantum information science](https://www.quantum.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2018_NSTC_National_Strategic_Overview_QIS.pdf), [semiconductors and microelectronics](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/POTUS-letter_PCAST-Semiconductors_09AUG2022.pdf), [advanced manufacturing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/National-Strategy-for-Advanced-Manufacturing-10072022.pdf), [advanced communication technologies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/04/27/the-biden-administration-invests-in-research-to-develop-advanced-communications-technologies/), and [biotechnology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/09/12/executive-order-on-advancing-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing-innovation-for-a-sustainable-safe-and-secure-american-bioeconomy/). DMREF is supportive of OSTP's multi-agency research and development [priorities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/M-21-32-Multi-Agency-Research-and-Development-Prioirties-for-FY-2023-Budget-.pdf) including [clean energy technologies](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/America%E2%80%99s%20Strategy%20to%20Secure%20the%20Supply%20Chain%20for%20a%20Robust%20Clean%20Energy%20Transition%20FINAL.docx_0.pdf) and infrastructure. Furthermore, DMREF aligns with national priorities for defense and homeland security, information technologies and high-performance computing, critical minerals and sustainability, and human health and welfare. DMREF supports the development of critical and emerging technologies as have been identified in a recent [report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/02-2022-Critical-and-Emerging-Technologies-List-Update.pdf) by the NSTC.\n\n\n\nIn support of federal [priorities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/M-21-32-Multi-Agency-Research-and-Development-Prioirties-for-FY-2023-Budget-.pdf), DMREF encourages efforts to promote diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility and advance environmental justice, across all R&D focus areas while building equitable science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce ecosystems for all learners and workers. When possible, activities should seek to encourage meaningful engagement with, and participation of, underserved communities and underrepresented groups in STEM. Aligning with Goal 3 of the 2021 [MGI Strategic Plan](https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/MGI-2021-Strategic-Plan.pdf), DMREF promotes diverse and inclusive education, training, and workforce development that can communicate across all components of the materials development continuum. Proposals led by or including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) are encouraged.\n\n\n\nProjects proposed to this solicitation must be directed by a team of at least two Senior Personnel with complementary expertise. The proposed research must involve a collaborative and iterative 'closed-loop' process wherein theory guides computational simulation, computational simulation guides experiments, and experimental observation further guides theory. The integrated research activities could involve some combination of:\n\n\n\n-  Strategies to advance fundamental knowledge related to materials design and manufacturability through testing methodology, which may include novel synthetic approaches, innovative processing, or advanced characterization techniques.\n\n-  Theory, computation/simulation, and modeling that leverage machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), data mining, or sparse approximation to predict behavior or assist in simplifying the analysis of multidimensional input data.\n\n-  Automated, high-throughput, and/or autonomous experimentation, including cyber-physical systems, that streamline and optimize the search of a materials space.\n\n-  Validation through synthesis, growth, processing, characterization, and/or device demonstration.\n\n\n\nThis solicitation represents a crosscutting activity involving the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Engineering (ENG), Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE), and Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP). Additionally, partnership with other federal agencies may lead to an interagency effort. Submitted proposals may be shared with DMREF's federal partners: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy & Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Naval Research (ONR), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Army's Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC), or the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).\n\n\n\nAwards are expected to range from $1,500,000 - $2,000,000 over a duration of four years.\n\n\n\nSubject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that the DMREF program will continue with competitions biennially in odd-numbered years.\"",

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number: EPA-OMS-23-01**\nThis EN Grant Program Solicitation Notice requests states, tribes, inter-tribal consortia, and territories submit applications with goal(s) supporting one or more of the three (3) EN funding areas. EN assistance agreement applicants can apply under one, or multiple, of the three FY23 EN funding areas listed below within a single application. Applicants should note that all three EN funding areas are of equal priority and that there is no preference given for applications which support more than one.\n\nPlease note that the phrase 'EN project opportunities' in the context of the EN Grant Program refers to the specific EPA data flow/project write-ups in Appendices A-C that fall under one of the three EN Funding Areas below. These project opportunity write-ups (which are listed and hyperlinked below) include a project description, relevant program status and plans, suggested project activities and estimated costs, and additional links and resources. Applicants are encouraged to use the suggested potential activities as project goals or objectives, as applicable.\n\n\n\n**Funding Area 2**\n\n**Eliminate paper submittals and expand e-reporting** \n\nStates, Territories, Tribes, and the EPA exchange large quantities of environmental data to analyze problems, make policy and tactical decisions, implement programs, and comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Traditionally these reports have been submitted by regulated entities and states in paper form. Over the last twenty years, EPA and its partners have increasingly opted to eliminate paper submittals and move towards standardized electronic reporting approaches based on EN data standards and technology. This evolution has included streamlining and modernizing multiple data collection processes through the web-based applications and portals, shared platforms, and the use of EN services/APIs to enable interoperable exchange and access to data.\n\n\n\n**Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Program Description**:\n\nThe SDWIS Program provides systems (SDWIS State, the Compliance Monitoring Data Portal (CMDP), and Drinking Water State-Federal-Tribal Information Exchange System (DW-SFTIES)) designed to assist primacy agencies (states, tribes, US territories with primacy over their drinking water programs; and EPA Regions) in managing their Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).\n\n-      SDWIS State is the current system used by 51 of 65 drinking water primacy agencies. Primacy agencies use XML files (SDWA Schema v3.6) to submit drinking water data to EPA for quarterly reporting. In\n\n-    2022, EPA added support for the lead service line inventory requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) to SDWIS State, updating the software to version 3.5.\n\n-     CMDP is a centralized, CROMERR- compliant web-based application, for electronic reporting of water samples data, compliance, and non-compliance data from laboratories and water systems to primacy agencies.\n\n-      DW-SFTIES will be a cloud-hosted program management and reporting system for primacy agencies; a sustainable long-term replacement for the SDWIS State suite of applications. Like SDWIS State, the objective of DW-SFTIES is to support state drinking water program implementation-taking advantage of new technologies and opportunities to do things better and more sustainably in the DW-SFTIES product than they currently are done in SDWIS State.\n\n**Status and Plans**:\n\n-      SDWIS State's 3.5 update was released in July 2022 and is available to drinking water primacy agencies.\n\n-    The 3.5 update provides support for the lead service line inventory requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule Revisions.\n\n-      CMDP has been operating since October 2016. As of August 2022, twenty-one (21) primacy agencies have adopted CMDP.\n\n-      Development of the DW-SFTIES is planned to start in Q1 of FY23 (between October -December\n\n-    2022) Primacy agencies receiving in-kind funding can use the DWPD IT Mission Support contract to complete actions.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: O-OVW-2023-171530\n**Overview of OVW**\n\n OVW is a component of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Created in 1995, OVW administers grant programs authorized by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and subsequent legislation and provides national leadership on issues of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. OVW grants support coordinated community responses to hold offenders accountable and serve victims.\n\n**Statutory Authority**\n\n34 U.S.C. 12291(b)(11) \n\n**About this OVW program**\n\n This program is authorized by 34 U.S.C. 12291(b)(11). The primary purpose of the OVW Training and Technical Assistance Initiative (TA Initiative) (CFDA 16.526) is to provide direct training and technical assistance to existing and potential OVW recipients and subrecipients to enhance their efforts to successfully implement projects supported by OVW grant funds. OVW's TA Initiative is designed to strengthen and build the capacity of civil and criminal justice system professionals and victim service providers across the nation to respond effectively to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and foster partnerships among organizations that have not traditionally worked together to address these crimes. For additional information about this program and related performance measures, including how awards contribute to the achievement of program goals and objectives, see:\n\n-    OVW grant program information: OVW Grants and Programs Webpage.\n\n-    Program performance measures under the Measuring Effectiveness Initiative:\n\n-    VAWA Measuring Effectiveness Initiative webpage.\n\n-    Program-specific sections in OVW's most recent report to Congress  on the effectiveness of VAWA grant programs.\n\n**Program Scope**\n\n Activities supported by this program are de termined by statute, federal regulations, and OVW policies. If an applicant receives an award, the funded project is bound by this solicitation, the DOJ Financial Guide, including updates to the financial guide after an award is made, the Solicitation Companion Guide, and the conditions of the award. All applicants must propose activities to serve the current and potential recipients or subrecipients of one or more OVW grant programs. OVW cannot support projects focusing on entities or individuals that are not eligible to receive funding, services, training, or other resources through any of OVW's grant programs.\n\n\n\n**Purpose Areas** \n\nFunds under the TA Initiative must be used for purposes identified in this solicitation. There are three categories of technical assistance in FY 2023: Competitive Targeted; Competitive Comprehensive; and Non-Competitive Comprehensive.\n\nApplicants must submit separate and distinct applications for each purpose area for which they are applying. For example, an applicant interested in applying to a purpose area to provide training and technical assistance (TTA) for judges should submit a separate application if it also wants to apply to a purpose area to provide trial advocacy and/or litigation skills training for attorneys.\n\nNote: OVW will support only the Targeted and Comprehensive TTA purpose areas identified in this solicitation. Applicants requesting to develop Targeted or Comprehensive projects for issues other than those listed below will be removed from consideration. Applications that modify or expand an OVW purpose area, including combining two or more purpose areas, will also be removed from consideration. To avoid confusion, OVW also requests that applicants applying to provide Targeted TTA refrain from using the word \"comprehensive\" in their project titles.\n\nFor each FY 2023 purpose area, OVW has projected the amount of funding available to support technical assistance efforts for that purpose area and the proposed project period. Applicants should not exceed the stated budget cap. OVW reserves the right not to make an award for a specific purpose area if there are no applications that effectively respond to the purpose area or if there are not sufficient funds to fully support the purpose area. If the same applicant is selected for two or more purpose areas, OVW may elect to make a single award for the two purpose areas. OVW may also make awards to multiple organizations for a single Targeted purpose area.\n\n**Competitive Targeted Technical Assistance** \n\nTargeted purpose areas are intended to provide current and potential OVW recipients and subrecipients with TTA related to a specific knowledge gap or promising practice within one or more of the four VAWA crimes.\n\n\n\n**Prosecution and Investigation of Online Abuse Initiative**\n\nProvide training and technical assistance to law enforcement and prosecution agencies to enhance their capacity to investigate and prosecute online crimes such as cyberstalking, online harassment, doxing, and the threat to or sharing of intimate images. The recipient of this award should be able to provide basic and advanced training and technical assistance that includes evidence-based strategies for holding offenders accountable and maintaining victim safety.\n\nBudget Cap\n\n  $1,000,000/ 36 months\"",

        "title": "\"Understanding Particle Acceleration and Transport\"",
        "description": "\"**Description**\nThe goal of this NPP is to contribute to instrument development of the IMAP/HIT instrument as well as to investigate particle acceleration using archival data. The research program will focus on folding solar energetic particle observations from missions such as ACE, GOES, and IMP8 together with gamma-ray observations from the COMpton TELescope (COMPTEL) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), to focus on the connection between related signatures of acceleration at the Sun with SEP detections at Earth. \n\n\n\nInstrument development will focus on the High-energy Ion Telescope (HIT) instrument on the IMAP mission. IMAP is a heliophysics mission in the Solar Terrestrial Probes program specifically to investigate two critical frontiers of research: the acceleration of energetic particles and the interaction of the solar wind with the local interstellar medium. IMAP is a sun-pointed spinner in orbit about the Sun-Earth L1 point scheduled to launch in 2025. IMAP has ten instruments that provide a complete set of observations to simultaneously dissect the particle injection and acceleration processes at 1 AU, while remotely probing the global heliospheric interaction and its response to particle populations generated by these processes. IMAP is a collaboration between Goddard and 24 institutions from the US, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and Japan. Goddard is responsible for the High-energy Ion Telescope (HIT) that will measure the elemental composition, energy, spectra, angular distributions and arrival times of H to Ni ions from ~2-~40 MeV/nucleon. One of the major focuses of this program is to make contributions to the development, testing, and calibration of the HIT instrument.\n\n\n\nWith an MeV I 3 sensitivity an order of magnitude improved over SMM, COMPton TELescope (COMPTEL)/CGRO archival data offers the best, and perhaps only, possibility to investigate a connection between small-flare I 3-ray emission, thermal and bremsstrahlung continuum emission from accelerated electrons (and associated radio emission), and SEPs. Another major goal of this proposed work is to search the archival COMPTEL data for small flare signatures in the I 3-ray emission using three proxies: soft X-ray emission (as measured by GOES), hard X-ray emission (as measured by BATSE), and SEPs focusing on the numerous small impulsive or 3He-rich SEP events. Furthermore, the small flare I 3-ray emission will be characterized as well as the spectral index, any I 3-ray line features, and time resolved spectra where possible, to deduce the relationship, both in energy spectra and composition, between SEPs and flare accelerated particles (electrons and ions).\n\n\n\nThe research program offers a valuable opportunity to combine experience in instrument development in addition to data analysis, both of which are expected to lead to several publications. The postdoctoral scholar will work closely with scientists at Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of New Hampshire.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-MH-23-330  \nThe overall goal of the NIH Research Career Development program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) support a variety of mentored and non-mentored career development award programs designed to foster the transition of new investigators to research independence and to support established investigators in achieving specific objectives. Candidates should review the different career development (K) award programs to determine the best program to support their goals. More information about Career programs may be found at the NIH Extramural Research Training and Career Development website.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the NIH BRAIN Initiative Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00) is to help outstanding postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to complete needed, mentored training and transition in a timely manner to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. The BRAIN Initiative Diversity K99/R00 program is intended to foster the development of a creative, independent researchers that will be competitive for subsequent independent funding and that will help advance the mission of the NIH and BRAIN Initiative research areas in particular. Applicants must have no more than 5 years of postdoctoral research experience at the time of the initial or the subsequent resubmission application. The K99/R00 award is intended for individuals who require at least 12 months of mentored research training and career development (K99 phase) before transitioning to the R00 award phase of the program. Consequently, the strongest applicants will require, and will propose, a well-conceived plan for 1-2 years of substantive mentored research training and career development that will help them become competitive candidates for tenure-track faculty positions and prepare them to launch robust, independent research programs. An individual who cannot provide a compelling rationale for at least one year of additional mentored research training at the time of award is not a strong candidate for this award. \n\n\n\nIndividuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible to apply to the K99/R00 program. If an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 award is made, neither the K99, nor the R00 award, will be made. The K99/R00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. The initial (K99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentord postdoctoral research training and career development. The second (R00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during teh K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. The two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. Therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, R00 awards will generally only be made to those K99 PDs/PIs who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the K99 period.\n\n\n\n**NIH and BRAIN Initiative Interest in Diversity**\n\n\n\nFostering diversity in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital. Promoting diversity in the extramural scientific workforce by enhancing the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, is critical to the success of the NIH mission and is consistent with the mandates of the 21st Century Cures Act. See the Policy Supporting the Next Generation Researchers Initiative, [NOT-OD-17-101](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-101.html).\n\n\n\nEvery facet of the United States scientific research enterprise-from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation-requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIH's ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, who will help to further NIH's mission.\n\n\n\nIn spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences (see the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity; [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)).\n\n\n\nThe Next Generation of Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences Researchers: Breaking Through (NASEM, 2018) encourages NIH and research institutions to diversify their postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences. In addition, women have been shown to be underrepresented in doctorate-granting research institutions at senior faculty levels in most biomedical-relevant disciplines including those relevant to the BRAIN Initiative (See data from the National Science Foundation National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics: Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering, special report available at [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/), especially the table describing science, engineering, and health doctorate holders employed in universities and 4-year colleges, by broad occupation, sex, years since doctorate, and faculty rank (Table 9-23 of Special Report NSF 13-304 from 2013.).\n\n\n\nThere is a large loss of talented researchers during the transition from postdoctoral training to junior faculty positions, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Evidence from several reports demonstrates that an intervention designed to facilitate successful transition at this point would benefit the research community and scientific teaching environment and would provide, in particular, needed role models for students from underrepresented groups ([Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads, National Academy of Sciences, 2011](https://grants.nih.gov/training/minority_participation.pdf); Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering, NASEM, 2007; [Bridges to Independence: Fostering the Independence of New Investigators in Biomedical Research, National Research Council, 2005](http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11249/bridges-to-independence-fostering-the-independence-of-new-investigators-in); and [Advancing the Nation's Health Needs: NIH Research Training Programs, National Academy of Sciences, 2005](http://www.nap.edu/booksearch.php?term=%22nrc+analysis%22&isbn=0309094275)). In addition to fostering a diverse pool of trainees, including those from underrepresented groups, targeted programs that focus on transition points along the postdoctorate to junior faculty career path could prevent the loss of highly trained scientists ([The Next Generation of Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences Researchers: Breaking Through](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25008/the-next-generation-of-biomedical-and-behavioral-sciences-researchers-breaking)). For example, women make up more than half of biomedical science undergraduate (58%) and postgraduate (53%) degrees but only 18% of full professors in the biomedical sciences ([www.nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp](http://www.nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp); [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/downloads/nsf17310-digest.pdf](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/static/downloads/nsf17310-digest.pdf)). Specifically for underrepresented neuroscience early career researchers, there is a decrease in the proportion of trainees from underrepresented groups from postdoctoral (9%) to tenure-stream neuroscience faculty (5%); [2011 Survey Report Neuroscience Departments and Programs](http://www.sfn.org/Careers-and-Training/Higher-Education-and-Training/Training-Program-Surveys). A diverse faculty is critical for providing role models for aspiring scientists from all backgrounds and achieving a research agenda that benefits the nation. Moreover, surveys reveal that a diverse faculty is important for attracting students to research and has a positive impact on retention and career mentoring for students from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\n\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is designed to assist transition to secure faculty positions, enhance the diversity of the pool of available faculty researchers, and enhance the skills needed to progress to independent NIH or other independent research support. As demonstrated in a 2011 NIH Individual Mentored Career Development Awards Program Evaluation, receipt of support under an individual mentored career development award had a measurable and significant impact on program participants, as seen in their publication records and subsequent applications for and receipt of NIH grants. Collectively, researchers who participated in a NIH K program had a significantly higher R01 success rate than those with no prior career development support. The BRAIN Initiative Diversity K99/R00 also aligns with the vision of NIH Leadership to \"focus on the system's nodes where attrition is most common, which means focusing on retention, continuity, flexibility, and innovation across branch points in the career pathway\" [CBE Life Sci Educ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008902/). 2016 Fall; v.15(3). It is envisioned that funding support from this K99/R00 will enhance the pool of well-trained researchers who are available to compete competitively for research opportunities available under the auspices of the BRAIN Initiative.\n\n\n\n**Next Generation Researchers in the BRAIN Initiative**\n\n\n\nSince 2014, the [Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) has aimed to accelerate the development and application of innovative neurotechnologies, enabling researchers to produce a new dynamic picture of the brain that reveals how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. It is expected that these advances will ultimately lead to new ways to treat and prevent brain disorders.\n\n\n\nAs one of several federal agencies involved in the BRAIN Initiative, NIH's contributions to the BRAIN Initiative were initially guided by \"[BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision](http://braininitiative.nih.gov/pdf/BRAIN2025_508C.pdf),\" a strategic plan that detailed seven [high-priority research areas](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/strategic-planning/brain-priority-areas). This plan was updated and enhanced in 2019 by: \"[The BRAIN Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf)\" and \"[The BRAIN Initiative and Neuroethics: Enabling and Enhancing Neuroscience Advances for Society](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/bns_roadmap_11_october_2019_sent_to_acd_for_oct_2019_revised_10282019_508c.pdf).\" This and other BRAIN Initiative Funding Opportunity Announcements (NOFOs) are based on this vision and issued with input from Advisory Councils of the [10 NIH Institutes and Centers supporting the BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/brain-partners), as assisted by the [NIH BRAIN Multi-Council Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/multi-council-working-group) and [Neuroethics Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group).\n\n\n\nThe NIH BRAIN Initiative recognizes that teams comprised of individuals with a diversity of experiences and perspectives that work together often outperform homogeneous teams. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce, including fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved populations participate in, and benefit from research, and enhancing public trust.\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral scientists are a critical component of the U.S. workforce. Trained in the latest research practices, they bring new knowledge and techniques into the research workforce. This NOFO is related to the education recommendations in Section II.7 of the BRAIN 2025 Report, as was underscored in the BRAIN 2.0 report. Specifically, this NOFO solicits applications from advanced-stage postdoctorates to acquire mentored research training using cutting-edge tools, theories and/or approaches in one or more of the high-priority areas of the BRAIN Initiative, including neuroethics. The NIH BRAIN Initiative Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00) is a trans-NIH effort to promote retention and advancement of a diverse pool of individuals, including those from underrepresented groups in the biomedical and behavioral sciences in BRAIN Initiative research careers.\n\n\n\nBoth the initial BRAIN 2025 Report and the BRAIN 2.0 Report strongly encourages scientists to cross traditional areas of expertise to conduct interdisciplinary research, and acknowledges the need to attract investigators and faculty recruits to neuroscience from quantitative disciplines, e.g., statistics, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering. Given the expressed need to bring those trained in quantitative disciplines to neuroscience research, applications from individuals in quantitative disciplines are strongly encouraged.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the National BRAIN Initiative, the NIH continues to have a substantial annual investment in neuroscience research and research training. The Institutes and Centers contributing to the NIH BRAIN Initiative ([http://braininitiative.nih.gov/](http://braininitiative.nih.gov/)) support those research and research training efforts through investigator-initiated applications as well as through specific NOFOs. Potential applicants to this NOFO are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Program staff if they have any questions about the best NOFO for their career development.\n\n\n\nFor BRAIN Initiative awards to date and examples of research areas funded, see [http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedAwards.htm](http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/funding/fundedAwards.htm).\n\n\n\n**Specific Objectives of the Career/Research Transition Opportunity**\n\n\n\nIndividuals must be in mentored, postdoctoral training positions to be eligible for support under the K99/R00 program. If an applicant achieves independence (any faculty or non-mentored research position) before a K99 award is made, neither the K99, nor the R00 award, will be made. The K99/R00 award will provide up to 5 years of support in two phases. The initial (K99) phase will provide support for up to 2 years of mentored postdoctoral research training and career development. The second (R00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. The two award phases are intended to be continuous in time. Therefore, although exceptions may be possible in limited circumstances, R00 awards will generally only be made to support those K99 PDs/PIs who accept independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty positions by the end of the K99 award period.\n\n\n\nApplicants for the NIH BRAIN Initiative Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00) program are expected to propose a research project and training plan in a scientific area relevant to one or more of the goals of the BRAIN Initiative, including neuroethics (see [http://braininitiative.nih.gov](http://braininitiative.nih.gov/)). The integrated program of research and training is expected to provide candidates with training using cutting-edge tools, theories and/or approaches that will prepare them to launch independent research careers in areas that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. To be considered responsive to this NOFO, the proposed research training plan must be relevant to the scientific goals of the BRAIN 2025 Report and BRAIN 2.0 Report, as described in the required Other Attachment for this application. Applications that are not relevant to one or more goals of these two BRAIN reports will not be reviewed.\n\n\n\n**Prior Consultation with Scientific/Research Staff**\n\n\n\nConsultation with Scientific/Research Contact staff listed in Section VII is strongly recommended, at least three weeks before the application due date. NIH staff can advise on candidate eligibility for this NOFO, and whether the proposed project meets the goals of this NOFO and the mission of the BRAIN Initiative and discuss responsiveness questions. Staff will not evaluate the technical and scientific merit of the proposed project; technical and scientific merit will be determined during peer review using the review criteria indicated in this NOFO. During the consultation phase, if the proposed project does not meet the programmatic needs of this NOFO, applicants will be strongly encouraged to consider other Funding Opportunities.\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO**\n\n\n\nApplications solely focused on the study of specific disease mechanisms, or existing disease therapeutics and treatments, will be considered nonresponsive. If an application focuses on the study of a disease or disorder of the CNS, the work must be primarily aimed at the development, optimization, testing, or novel use of technology where application to the disorder or disease is essential for demonstration of the technological approach. Studies for the investigation of specific diseases and disorders, or the mechanisms of such diseases should be directed to the appropriate NIH Institutes.\n\n\n\nProposed research that is not responsive to this NOFO will not be reviewed.\n\n\n\n**Note:** This Funding Opportunity Announcement (NOFO) is designed specifically for candidates proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or a separate ancillary study to an existing trial, as part of their research and career development. Applicants not planning an independent clinical trial, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator, must apply to companion NOFO ([RFA-MH-22-331](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-23-331.html)) .\n\n\n\nNIH defines a clinical trial as \"A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.\" ([NOT-OD-15-015](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html)).\n\n\n\nNIH not only supports trials of safety and efficacy, it also supports mechanistic exploratory studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and are designed to explore or understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. These studies may focus on basic and/or translational discovery research in healthy human subjects and in human subjects who are affected by the pathophysiology of diseases and disorders. By addressing basic questions and concepts in biology, behavior, and pathophysiology, these studies may provide insight into understanding human diseases and disorders along with potential treatments or preventive strategies. NIH also supports biomarker studies that meet the definition of a clinical trial and that may provide information about physiological function, target engagement of novel therapeutics, and/or the impact of therapeutics on treatment response. NIH thus supports studies that meet the definition of clinical trials (as noted above) but do not seek to establish safety, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, clinical management, and/or implementation of preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions. See [Section VIII. Other Information](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-043.html#_Section_VIII._Other) for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the [Research Methods Resources](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/) website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-24-158  \n**Introduction**  \n\n\n\nThe National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), works to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. Translation is the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public - from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. NCATS focuses on research that impacts systemic change across the entire translational spectrum from basic research, pre-clinical research, clinical research, clinical implementation, and public health. NCATS encourages innovative approaches to systemic change and is disease and science domain agnostic. NCATS is transforming the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster, and strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to all patients.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage applications from Small Business Concerns (SBCs) to pursue the development of improved clinical diagnostics or the development of alternative clinical diagnostics that address health inequities created by clinical laboratory assays and/or point-of-care devices that fail to incorporate diverse patient groups. Applicants will identify a potential issue within a clinical diagnostic or group of clinical diagnostics that perpetuates health inequity and disparities, clearly define the disparity issue, and develop a solution to address the concern. In using this funding, it is expected that recipients will lay the groundwork for implementation of more equitable clinical diagnostics that lead to improved health, healthcare delivery, and the elimination of health disparities.\n\n\n\n**Key Definitions**  \n\n\n\n**Populations that experience health disparities (HD Populations):** Populations defined in section 464z-3(d)(1) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 285t(d)(1) as \"health disparity populations\" based on higher overall rates of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival rates in the population as compared to the health status of the general population. NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations currently include Black Americans and African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, individuals or groups with disabilities, and sexual and gender minorities.\n\n\n\n**Clinical Diagnostic**: clinical tools, assays, devices or other resources for the purpose of identifying, characterizing, defining or diagnosing a disease state to identify, treat or prevent disease, as well as the screening, prognosis, therapeutic monitoring and/or evaluation of the progression of any disease.\n\n\n\n**Non-biological Parameter**: parameters utilized in a clinical diagnostic that do not have a biological context, such as race and/or ethnicity, cultural differences between groups or population distribution, among others.\n\n\n\n**Social Determinants of Health (SDOH):** SDOH are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. \n\n\n\n**Background**  \n\n\n\nAn important component to efficient and successful medical diagnoses and interventional decisions are results obtained from clinical laboratory tests and point-of-care devices (such as pulse oximeters and glucometers), which can provide insight into physiological states within a patient that are not directly observable. However, many of these clinical diagnostics do not reflect the diversity of patient populations, often utilizing non-biological parameters as a proxy for diversity. As a result, clinical diagnostics suffer greatly from a diversity issue, causing underrepresented groups to receive inferior medical treatment and in some cases can cause complete loss of opportunities for early diagnoses.\n\n\n\nDuring the development phase for these clinical diagnostics, it is often the case that inadequate attention to biological diversity of patient populations leads to the release and utilization of many assays / devices that work best for only select populations and may disadvantage populations that experience health disparities. The purpose of this NOFO is to promote the development of improved clinical diagnostics or the development of alternative clinical diagnostics that address health disparities created by clinical laboratory assays and/or point-of-care devices that fail to incorporate diverse patient groups. This NOFO aims to engage and support small businesses in providing seed (i.e., early-stage investment) funding for developing solutions to a clinical diagnostic or group of clinical diagnostics that perpetuates health inequity and disparities that disadvantage African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, individuals or groups with disabilities, and sexual and gender minorities. \n\n\n\n**Research Objectives and Specific Areas of Interest**  \n\n\n\nUnder this NOFO, research may take place within the context of existing clinical diagnostics within established health care settings or may involve the proposal of new clinical diagnostics. Applicants will need to provide a clear vision of the proposed clinical diagnostic, who would be the consumer of this diagnostic, and how they plan to take this technology to market. Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that what they develop will meet the approval requirements of the FDA for usage of this technology in a clinical setting. Applicants must develop clinical diagnostics that are as accessible or more accessible to HD populations than currently available diagnostics and should meet or exceed the quality of existing diagnostics. Applicants are encouraged to consider aspects of social determinants of health (SDOH) during the development process, though SDOH should not be the sole focus of their project. Applicants should include a plan for including input from relevant HD populations to ensure the needs of the HD population are addressed. \n\n\n\nThis NOFO accepts different types of projects with the intent of developing clinical diagnostics that address patient inequity and healthcare disparities including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  Novel technologies that address a quantifiable, known issue in an existing clinical diagnostic that perpetuates health disparities, such as pigment variation and its relation to light absorption in imaging and point-of-care devices. \n\n-  Novel technologies utilizing equitable parameters to replace clinical diagnostics that incorporate non-biological parameters, such as race.\n\n-  Projects that address health inequities in analytics or bioinformatics that support or are used in the development of clinical diagnostics, such as variant identification, annotation and interpretation in molecular diagnostics.\n\n-  Projects associated with addressing and correcting health inequities in clinical decision support tools and/or software intended to be utilized in the clinical environment.\n\n-  Pilot or small-scale projects that validate new technology designed to address an identified health disparity within an existing clinical diagnostic.\n\n-  Larger-scale studies for which pilot data or small-scale success for correction of a health disparity has already been documented, but which need further development to enter the market. \n\n\n\nExamples of activities and corresponding SBIR Phase assignment includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n**Phase I.** The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and determine the quality of performance of the small business recipient organization before proceeding to Phase II.\n\n\n\n**Phase II.** For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH will accept Direct to Phase II applications regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Direct to Phase II awards should be submitted as \"New\" applications and not continuations (\"Renewal\") of Phase I SBIR or STTR projects. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase project period.\n\n\n\n**Fast Track.** In an NIH STTR fast-track both Phase I and Phase II are submitted and reviewed as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should:\n\n\n\n1.  Include a clear rationale of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed approach and technology\n\n2.  Demonstrate a high probability of commercialization through a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase project period; and\n\n3.  Include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timebound milestone deliverables. It is important to clearly state the go / no-go milestone(s) that will determine transition to Phase II and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-STTR) from future commercialization partners. \n\n\n\nFor Fast-Track applications, an administrative review will be conducted by NIH Program staff to decide whether a project will be considered for transition from the Phase I to Phase II. Phase II eligible projects must successfully accomplish milestones of Phase 1 as defined in Milestones Plan. Funding for the Phase II application will be contingent upon (1) assessment of the Phase I progress report and determination that the Phase I goals and milestones were achieved; (2) an update (as necessary) of the Commercialization Plan; (3) determination of the project's potential for meeting the mission of the awarding component and for commercial success; (4) review and approval of other documents necessary for continuation; and (5) availability of funds. The continuation application package is due 2 months prior to the anticipated start date of Phase II.\n\n\n\n**National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)**\n\n\n\nThe mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases, the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research, and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases. For information on NIAMS SBIR/STTR program, please refer to [https://seed.nih.gov/NIAMS_SBIR_home](https://seed.nih.gov/NIAMS_SBIR_home).NIAMS will not support clinical trials with this NOFO.\n\n\n\n**Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office (SGMRO)**\n\n\n\nThe SGMRO coordinates research and activities related to the health and well-being of sexual and gender minority (SGM; defined for NIH research in [NOT-OD-19-139](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-139.html)) populations by working directly with the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) and serves as a liaison for the research community to ensure SGM populations are considered and represented in research activities across the agency. The SGMRO does not have grant-making authority and can only support grants selected for funding after review by one of the ICs participating in this announcement and after a co-funding request is initiated through the IC. Please reach out to the relevant scientific/research contact(s) identified in this announcement with any questions about IC-specific research priorities and funding. More SGM- and SGMRO-specific information is available in the [NIH Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the Health and Well-being of Sexual and Gender Minorities FY 2021-2025](http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/SGMStrategicPlan_2021_2025.pdf), the [FY 2021 NIH SGM Research Portfolio Analysis](https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/SGMRO-Portfolio-Analysis-FY2021-FINAL_508%5B57%5D.pdf), and the office's Research Resources [webpage](https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro/sgm-research-resources).\n\n\n\nFor this NOFO, SGMRO encourages research across the life course that focuses on the clinical diagnostic needs of and diagnostics- and device-based inequities faced by SGM populations and SGM people who are members of other populations that experience health disparities and inequities ([link](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/resources/understanding-health-disparities/minority-health-and-health-disparities-definitions.html#:~:text=Populations%20that%20experience%20health%20disparities,Underserved%20rural%20communities)). When appropriate, SGMRO encourages consideration and incorporation of relevant concepts (e.g., minority stress, social safety, intersectionality, stigma), research strategies (e.g., community-led or -engaged research, trauma-informed research, strengths-based approaches), and frameworks (e.g., [SGM Health Disparities Research Framework](https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH-SGM-Health-Disparities-Research-Framework-FINAL_508c.pdf), [NIMHD Research Framework](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/nimhd-framework.html)).\n\n\n\n**National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)**\n\n\n\nThe National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) strives to improve the health of all humans through advances in genomics research.

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** DFOP0016624  \nThe Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) announces an open competition for projects in support of a forthcoming Child Protection Compact (CPC) Partnership between the United States and the Government of Romania.\n\n\n\nU.S.-Romania CPC Partnership goal: The Government of Romania combats forced child labor and child sex trafficking in a coordinated, victim-centered, and proactive manner that addresses targeted risk factors, ensures comprehensive victim protection, and effectively investigates, prosecutes, and convicts child traffickers.  The anticipated overarching objectives (pending the signing of the CPC Partnership) are:\n\n\n\nObjective 1 (Prevention): The Government of Romania coordinates with civil society on child trafficking prevention efforts to reduce the influence of risk factors and vulnerabilities leading to victimization through trafficking in persons.\n\n\n\nObjective 2 (Protection): The Government of Romania supports child trafficking victims directly by providing accessible, trauma-informed, and victim-centered care and by supporting local civil society working on protection throughout the country.\n\n\n\nObjective 3 (Prosecution): Justice sector actors utilize trafficking-specific legal frameworks to identify child trafficking victims, investigate cases, and prosecute and convict perpetrators of child trafficking in a child-friendly, victim-centered and trauma-informed manner.\n\n\n\nObjective 4 (Partnership):  The Government of Romania addresses child trafficking in a coordinated manner across all relevant national and county authorities as well as with civil society.\n\n\n\nThe TIP Office will allocate funding for anti-child trafficking projects in Romania through an open, competitive process.  Applicants are invited to submit a project narrative (no more than 5 pages in length) that includes a situational assessment of child trafficking in Romania, identifies existing key gaps and potential intervention points, and details previous work the organization has conducted on child trafficking and child protection in Romania.  Proposals should also document existing relationships the applicant (and when applicable, sub-applicants) holds with relevant entities within the Government of Romania.  Applicants should not propose specific activities; an implementation plan will be created and validated at a later date based on a joint U.S. government and Government of Romania co-\n\ncreation process following grantee selection.  Applicants are required to submit at least one letter of intent to cooperate from a relevant Government of Romania entity.  Applicants must also submit a budget summary and resumes/CVs for key personnel (see Section D: Application and Submission Information).\n\n\n\nApplicants should develop proposals that demonstrate their organization's knowledge of the child trafficking situation in Romania, key gaps and intervention points; as well as their capacity to work with the U.S. government, Government of Romania, and other stakeholders to implement a successful CPC Partnership.\n\nUpon technical and proposal review and successful negotiation, the TIP Office will select applicant(s) and sign award(s) requiring that awardee(s) convene with the U.S. Government and the Government of Romania within 90 days of signing the award to develop an implementation plan to achieve the goal and objectives of the CPC Partnership.  Once the implementation plan is finalized, awardee(s) will be required to submit a revision to their proposal within 30 days that includes updated project narrative and budget summaries to reflect the planned activities in the implementation plan, which will be formalized as an award update through an amendment.  Additional documents in the award revision include: monitoring, evaluation, research, and learning (MERL) plans; timelines; risk mitigation and contingency plans; a line-item budget; and a budget narrative.  Continuation of the award will be contingent upon successful negotiation of these additional elements, including the implementation plan.\n\n\n\nApplicants should develop proposals that cover the entire funding amount they propose for a multi-year program, with the maximum award amount set at $10,000,000 (USD) for up to five (5) years, understanding that the final budget and proposal narrative will be revised post-award via amendment to reflect activities from the implementation plan agreed by both partner governments.\n\nApplicants may submit proposals that align with all four objectives or focus on a specific objective or a subset of the objectives, depending on the expertise of the organization.  If submitting a proposal that focuses on specific objectives, budgets must reflect an appropriate distribution of funds across the smaller number of objectives (i.e., the TIP Office will not award the total award ceiling of funds to a project that only addresses two of the four objectives).  The TIP Office reserves the right to reduce, revise, or increase proposal activities in accordance with the needs of the program and the availability of funds.\n\n\n\nThe TIP Office recognizes the value and importance of partnerships and collaborative efforts in anti-trafficking work.  Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals that reflect partnerships among organizations and are expected to work collaboratively with relevant government ministries and authorities to coordinate with related activities supported by other donors.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to form consortia to bring together organizations with varied expertise to propose a comprehensive project in one proposal.\"",

        "description": " Analysis**1. Authority** \n\nThis funding opportunity is authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as amended. The resulting award will be subject to 2 CFR 200 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and USAID's supplement, 2 CFR 700, as well as the additional requirements found in Section F.\n\n\n\n**2. Background** \n\nAs USAID-supported countries strive to reduce preventable child and maternal mortality and advance primary health care, they face increasingly complex challenges. They need to identify and pursue proven and innovative approaches to improve the quality, coverage and equity of family planning (FP) and reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition (RMNCH+N) health interventions while also addressing emerging challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and expanding access to services to vulnerable populations as well as strengthening systems and capabilities at national and sub-national levels. The Global Health Program Evaluation, Analysis, Research and Learning (GH PEARL) mechanism is envisioned as providing global technical leadership with a broad range of cutting-edge activities in monitoring, evaluation, research and learning (MERL) along with related knowledge management and knowledge translation to provide USAID-supported countries with high-quality, actionable evidence to assess program effectiveness, identify and overcome barriers to program implementation, and guide decision making.\n\nThe design of GH PEARL recognizes the importance of linking countries and regional institutions to global standards, drawing upon advances in digital health; health services research; and the data, behavioral, and implementation sciences. GH PEARL builds upon MERL lines of work that were previously undertaken by centrally-managed awards including the Data for Impact (D4I) associate award under Measure Evaluation Phase IV; the Health Evaluation, Applied Research and Development (HEARD) award; and Coordinating Implementation Research to Communicate Learning and Evidence (CIRCLE) contract. This consolidation of work that was previously spread across multiple mechanisms is intended to increase efficiency and cost effectiveness, enhance collaboration on innovations, and expand global technical leadership and state-of-the-art measurement of the impact of global health activities by pooling a broad base of highly-skilled MERL experts in one mechanism.\n\nThe purpose of this activity is to support effective generation and use of high-quality data and evidence to strengthen policies and program implementation to improve health and save lives in low- and middle-income countries. GH PEARL will provide highly-skilled technical assistance with a quick turn-around time and attention to cost considerations to fill needs spanning the gamut from rigorous process and performance evaluations of projects and health portfolios to complex outcome, developmental, and impact evaluations, and costing analysis in USAID partner countries.  The broad spectrum of MERL provided by GH PEARL to support LMIC country-led efforts includes real-time measurement of results; innovative metrics; strengthened quality and use of FP/RMNCH+N elements in health information systems; improvements in data quality, analysis and visualization; site monitoring; and research. GH PEARL will serve as a resource to monitor and evaluate programs, conduct research to fill evidence gaps, and improve understanding of barriers to optimal program operations and their root causes as well as building the capacity of other organizations to conduct similar work.\n\nRelated knowledge translation and management services (KT/KM) will support host countries, Missions, and USAID/W by synthesizing and using findings to enhance collaboration, learning and adaptation (CLA) to improve policies and programs, drawing upon best practices from other MERL and KM activities, with the overall goal of accelerating progress toward sustainable development solutions.\"",

        "title": "\"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Promoting Vaccine Access",
        "description": " Acceptance and Uptake among Children**Purpose**  \n\n\n\nVaccines are a central component of preventive care for populations of high priority to the NICHD. NICHD's priority populations include infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and persons with physical and intellectual disabilities, particularly those who are also underserved or experience health disparities. Strategies that promote access, acceptance and uptake of CDC-recommended vaccines among these populations have the potential not only to reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, but also to promote health and well-being and to improve trust in science and health care. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes this initiative especially timely because many jurisdictions seek to effectively deploy vaccines against COVID-19 as they are approved and become more readily available for children. Furthermore, insights gained from this initiative may inform efforts to ameliorate declines in rates of routine childhood and adolescent vaccine delivery.\n\n\n\nThe reasons for lower rates of vaccine uptake are varied, but include concerns about vaccine safety, possible long-term side effects, the potential for interactions with prescribed medications, and pre-existing conditions or disabilities. These concerns can be compounded by lack of vaccine acceptance due to skepticism regarding the accuracy or completeness of available information, low perceived risk of infection or severe illness, low perceived efficacy of available vaccines, beliefs regarding other preventive strategies against vaccine-preventable infections, or high perceived risk of adverse events. Finally, structural and historical factors, including costs and systemic barriers that impede access to care, can all have the common end effect of decreasing rates of vaccine access. Social determinants of health (SDoH), defined as the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age ([https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health)), intersect with these structural and historical factors in ways that also influence rates of vaccine access, acceptability and uptake. For many NICHD priority populations, vaccine uptake has added complexity because the person providing consent for vaccination may not be the person receiving the vaccine.\n\n\n\nThis NOSI encourages applications that address dimensions of access, acceptance and uptake of CDC-recommended vaccines among infants, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and persons with disabilities, especially among populations who are underserved or experience health disparities.\n\n\n\nHigh priority applications will focus on NICHD-priority populations and issues that include but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n-  Research to identify age-, geographic-, and culturally-specific approaches to reducing barriers to vaccine access and increasing vaccination acceptance and uptake.\n\n-  Community-engaged research to identify strategies most likely to increase vaccine access, acceptance and uptake. This includes proposals utilizing trusted health, education and social service providers; training lay community members; and/or implementing models of shared decision-making to address concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy.\n\n-  Research to examine and address understanding of communication, education, or other engagement strategies on vaccine uptake decision-making, including the impact of misconceptions, misinformation, risk perceptions, and trust in vaccine recommendations.\n\n-  Research using social media, digital marketing, mobile applications, or other innovative technologies to identify and address institutional, structural or individual-level barriers to vaccine access, acceptance and uptake, including accessibility, discrimination, and misinformation, distrust, fear, or stigma regarding vaccines.\n\n-  Research using innovative data collection methods to identify, prioritize and reach specific population sub-groups for vaccine interventions.\n\n-  Research to identify how social determinants of health (SDoH) may exacerbate or mitigate disparities in vaccine access, acceptance and uptake for specific NICHD priority populations.\n\n-  Research to identify interactions between factors, including policy interventions, that impact vaccine acceptance and uptake and factors associated with other known health disparities among NICHD priority populations.\n\n-  Research utilizing dissemination and implementation methods to expand or accelerate the reach of efficacious interventions for improving vaccine access, acceptance and uptake in clinical and community settings, including primary care, childcare, school, pharmacy, and other community-based venues.\n\n\n\nProjects targeting access, acceptance and uptake of routine vaccines among children and adolescents will be considered within scope, with the exception of projects focused specifically on vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV). Applications addressing HPV vaccine uptake among children and adolescents belonging to populations that experience health disparities may, however, be within scope for another NIH institute or center as described, for example, in [NOT-MD-21-008](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MD-21-008.html).\n\n\n\nProjects targeting access and uptake of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) will also be considered within scope for this NOSI.\n\n\n\nThe following topic areas are NOT within scope for this NOSI:\n\n\n\n-  Applications with a focus on vaccine safety or efficacy.\n\n-  Applications evaluating relationships between vaccination and specific health outcomes.\n\n\n\nApplications on these topics will not be considered for funding by NICHD.\"",

Researchers, in the United States and abroad, who are working on novel approaches that may contribute substantively to scientific understanding of tinnitus, breakthroughs in treatments, and possible cures are encouraged to apply for an ATA grant award.\n\n\n\nScientists, academics, and healthcare professionals affiliated with non-profit medical and research institutions are encouraged to apply for ATA grants and awards, which include:\n\n\n\n-   $60,000 Innovative Tinnitus Research Grant for Established Investigators\n\n-   $25,000 Innovative Tinnitus Research Grant for Early Investigators\n\n-   $2,000 travel awards for students and postdoctoral fellow investigators\n\n-   $2,000 conference awards to host a virtual or in-person conference\n\n\n\nATA grants are for one- or two-year investigations. All tinnitus-related proposals will be reviewed in a highly competitive process by the ATA's Scientific Advisory Committee, and approved by the Board of Directors, following a peer-reviewed process modeled after the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n\n\nBy funding original scientific research, the ATA brings researchers  ideas to life and ensures that promising tinnitus advances are uncovered. The ATA's research grants program was launched in 1981, when virtually no research was being conducted on tinnitus in the United States. The program was pivotal in fostering interest in the field of tinnitus research and building awareness that tinnitus negatively impacts quality of life. The program, which is funded through donations, is grounded in seed grants that enable researchers to obtain significant data for innovative pilot studies, which is a prerequisite for applying for more substantial funding from bigger institutions, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n\nThe ATA is pleased to support the professional development of tinnitus researchers. ATA Travel and Conference Awards help graduate students and postdoctoral scholars attend or host conferences to present tinnitus-related papers, posters, or other material. Awards are granted on a rolling basis.\"",

        "title": "\"23/157 Preoperative Rehabilitation and Early Mobilisation for Shoulder Replacement\"",
        "description": "\"The Health Technology Assessment Programme is accepting Stage 1 applications to their commissioned workstream for this primary research topic.\nThe aim of the HTA Programme is to ensure that high quality research information on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and broader impact of healthcare treatments and tests are produced in the most efficient way for those who plan, provide or receive care from NHS and social care services. The commissioned workstream invites applications in response to calls for research on specific questions which have been identified and prioritised for their importance to the NHS, patients and social care.\n\n\n\n**Research Question:**\n\n\n\n1.  What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of preoperative rehabilitation for upper limb surgery (shoulder joint replacement)? \n\n2.  What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early versus delayed shoulder mobilisation post-surgery?\n\n\n\n-   Intervention: 1) Individualised preoperative rehabilitation (at least two months prior to surgery). 2) First rehabilitation/mobilisation within 24 hours of surgery.\n\n-   Patient group: Adults awaiting primary shoulder joint replacement. Applications are encouraged which include recruitment from geographic populations with high disease burden which have been historically underserved by research activity in this field.\n\n-   Setting: Secondary care.\n\n-   Comparators: 1) No formal preoperative rehabilitation or usual care which does not involve an individualised programme. 2) First rehabilitation/mobilisation after 24 hours of surgery.\n\n-   Study design: A randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot phase to test key trial processes, such as recruitment and adherence. Clear stop and go criteria should be provided to inform progression from pilot to full trial. The trial design could encompass 3 stages: Stage 1 to develop the intervention package, Stage 2 to implement the intervention and assess feasibility, and Stage 3tocompleteanRCT. To answer the 2 research questions efficiently the study could employ a factorial design assessing 2 factors (preoperative rehabilitation and early mobilisation), each with 2 levels (intervention and comparator), resulting in 4 groups:\n\n    -   1) prehabilitation and early mobilisation,\n\n    -   2) prehabilitation and delayed mobilisation,\n\n    -   3) no prehabilitation and early mobilisation,\n\n    -   4) no prehabilitation and delayed mobilisation. \n\n-   Important outcomes: Shoulder function; Pain.\n\n    -   Other outcomes: Quality of life (for example, EQ-5D, EQ-VAS - applicants to define and justify); PROMs; adverse events; revision of joint replacement (time to event); reoperation including dislocation; deep and superficial surgical site infection; hospital readmissions; length of stay; sleep; health economic measures (direct and indirect costs).\n\n    -   Existing Core Outcomes: These should be included amongst the list of outcomes unless a good rationale is provided to do otherwise. Applicants are encouraged to report recruitment and findings disaggregated by sex (and other demographic factors where relevant).\n\n-   Minimum duration of follow-up: 12 months. Longer-term follow-up: If appropriate, researchers should consider obtaining consent to allow potential future follow-up through efficient means (such as routine data) as part of a separately funded study.\n\n\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n\n\nShoulder joint replacement surgery is the third most common joint replacement surgery. It is used to reduce pain and movement problems in people with conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fractures. NICE guidance NG157 makes a number of research recommendations for shoulder surgery, including the use of preoperative rehabilitation (or prehabilitation) and early mobilisation of the shoulder post-operatively.\n\n\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that prehabilitation prior to surgery can have benefits for patient recovery in lower limb surgeries; findings which are thought to be applicable to upper limb surgery. Preoperative rehabilitation can include exercises to do before and after surgery that will aid recovery, advice regarding lifestyle (for example, weight management, diet, and stopping smoking) and maximising functional independence and quality of life. Interventions and advice targeting these health behaviours could enhance patient recovery through clinical outcomes (for example, pain and function), health related quality of life and by reducing the risk of post-operative complications and prolonged rehabilitation needs. Preoperative rehabilitation could also positively impact the NHS by reducing the length of hospital stays and readmission rates.\n\n\n\nResearch suggests that the sooner the shoulder can be mobilised the sooner formal shoulder rehabilitation can begin, leading to quicker functional recovery. Returning to a more normal functional existence is very important to people who have undergone surgery, and can also positively impact the NHS through reduced length of hospital stays, less need for extended postoperative rehabilitation, and reduced readmissions.\n\n\n\nNICE guidance states the need for high quality evidence for preoperative rehabilitation interventions for people listed for shoulder replacement surgery, and early mobilisation of the shoulder post-surgery. The HTA programme therefore wishes to fund a study that will investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of preoperative rehabilitation and early mobilisation for shoulder replacement.\n\n\n\nTo support the ambitions of [NIHR's Best Research for Best Health: the next chapter](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/best-research-for-best-health-the-next-chapter/27778), we strongly encourage the inclusion of nurses, midwives and allied health professionals within well-developed research teams responding to this call, to increase the building of research activity, capacity and capability across these professions.\n\n\n\nDepending on the level of experience, this could be through the role of lead applicant, as joint co-applicant (supported by detailed mentoring plans submitted with the application), or as a co-applicant member of the research team. Through this activity, NIHR aims to support nurses, midwives and allied health professionals to become future research leaders and release the potential to lead, use, deliver and participate in research as a part of their job.\"",

        "description": " Vital Preaching Grants Program For Worshiping Communities\"**Vital Worship, Vital Preaching Grants for worshiping communities** allow a wide range of Christian worshiping communities to focus on projects that connect public worship with Christian discipleship and faith formation.\n\n\n\n**Purpose:** Our aim is to support year-long projects that show promise in fostering renewed or strengthened worship practices within worshiping communities in the United States or Canada. (See also: [Vital Worship, Vital Preaching Grants for teacher-scholars](https://worship.calvin.edu/grants/teacher-scholars/).)\n\n\n\n**How Long Is the Grant Program?**\n\n\n\nThe grant program takes place over the course of one year. Many congregations and other worshiping communities with whom we've worked have discovered that a year spent focusing on worship can revitalize their ability to share the good news of the gospel.\n\n\n\nIn addition, these projects have taught us that when communities focus on worship, others are drawn to worship with them. Therefore, even though the grant project lasts for just one year, a Vital Worship, Vital Preaching grant can plant seeds that continue to grow long after the project ends.\n\n\n\n**What Types of Projects Can Receive Grants?**\n\n\n\nWorshiping communities grant projects can focus on a variety of Christian worship practices, including the following:\n\n\n\n-   Bible reading\n\n-   Preaching/sermon/homily\n\n-   Public prayer\n\n-   Baptism\n\n-   Lord s Supper/communion/Eucharist\n\n-   Congregational music and singing\n\n-   Visual arts\n\n-   Storytelling\n\n-   Universal design and responsive design for worship\n\n-   Cultural engagement\n\n-   And more!\n\n\n\nHere are a few examples of projects this grant program has funded for worshiping communities:\n\n\n\n-   In-depth study of the theology of worship in relation to worship practices\n\n-   Study of baptism or the Lord s Supper and how these sacraments connect with the life of the community\n\n-   Exploration of the Psalms and how they shape lyrics and music in worship\n\n-   Collaboration between pastors and lay leaders to plan worship that integrates sermons with other aspects of worship or congregational life\n\n-   A year-long process exploring ways to use the unique gifts of members of all ages in planning and leading worship\"",

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation's agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** The project's ultimate goal is to develop knowledge and readily available technology for solving quality (in its broader meaning) issues associated with fresh and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables that can result in higher consumption and the reduction of fresh-produce loss and waste.  \n\nRelevant objectives for this research will be one or two of the following (or alternatives related to them):\n\n\n\n1.  determine pre-harvest factors that condition status of prevalent microbial communities on harvested food products, including chemicals, environmental factors (i.e. in CEA, conventional and Urban Ag), plant metabolites and as a result of the interaction with other microorganisms\n\n2.  assess postharvest practices, biological process and environmental conditions that impact shelf life of retailed fresh foods, in order to support development of microorganism and/or plant-based active compounds to extend produce's shelf life\n\n3.  determine the potential of using nature-base nanoparticle coatings on equipment and food products to optimize postharvest operations, reduce the use or loss of production resources and maximize shelf life of food products\n\n\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor (or mentors), the selected participant will play a role in a multi-disciplinary research team. The particular role of the participant can be tailored based on the participant's technical strength:\n\n\n\n-  An postdoctoral fellow with a microbiology strength will be involved in designing and conducting research studies involving selected-natural occurring microorganisms, that are associated with intrinsic food qualities (uptake of nutrients by consumers) and/or that limit postharvest shelf life and/or with studies that track surrogate pathogen's dynamics from seeds to fresh-cut processing, while learning new skills on food processing, plant physiology and produce postharvest handling.\n\n-  An postdoctoral fellow with a background in plant and postharvest physiology and technology will be involved in targeted metabolomics of plants-base foods gaining additional knowledge on microbial communities interaction with plant's nutrition and defense mechanisms and processing operations that alter shelf life of foods. \n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:** There will be plenty of opportunities for the participant's training and testing in different methodologies, using diverse facilities, including laboratory spaces that are well established and other that are initiating research work, as well as pilot food processing plants, growth chambers and greenhouse units. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2022.** Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the [Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details](https://orise.orau.gov/usda-ars/applicants/default.html) page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\"",

        "title": "\"Public Service Scholarship\"",
        "description": "\"**The Public Sector**\nThe public sector refers to the segment of the economy responsible for public services and government-run enterprises. These services, like telecommunications, electricity, law enforcement, education, healthcare, and infrastructure development (like bridges, roads, water supply, tunnels, sewers, and public transportation), are publicly funded and cater to tax-payers and non-tax-payers alike. They aim to benefit society collectively and are usually self-supported or non-profit.\n\n\n\n**The Public Sector's Role**\n\n\n\nThe public sector in the United States serves multiple purposes, primarily driven by the need for stability and economic advancement. It encompasses essential services like education, the postal system, military defense, and infrastructure maintenance, which benefit society. Due to potential biases or profit-oriented motives, these services would be challenging to assign to private entities.\n\n\n\nAcross many states, the government functions as a regulator, establishing a framework for private businesses to ensure they operate in the public's best interests. These regulations aim to balance profitability for companies while preventing steep price hikes, as the public relies on these services. Additionally, the public sector plays a role in maintaining economic stability and growth. Government branches can influence economic conditions by adjusting tax rates, managing the money supply, and controlling credit use, helping to moderate extreme economic fluctuations.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the government provides direct assistance to individuals unable to support themselves, serving as a safety net for those in need.\n\n\n\n**SCHOLARSHIP BACKGROUND**\n\n\n\n**Why it matters for today's college students to speak up and contribute their perspectives on the public sector:**\n\n\n\n1.  **Progressive Influence:** Millennials entering the public sector bring forward progressive viewpoints and expectations. They seek employers who respect these perspectives, shaping a more forward-thinking environment.\n\n2.  **Evolution of Public Works:** Involvement in public projects isn't confined to government organizations anymore. Individuals interested in serving the public have diverse options beyond local municipalities. Despite this, the public sector remains crucial for influencing policies, and a shift away from it might affect future legislation.\n\n3.  **Blurring Sectoral Boundaries:** The distinction between public and private sectors is fading. Students are prioritizing issues or policies over specific roles or professions. Their focus is on finding positions in the public or private domain that allow them to serve their chosen causes effectively.\n\n4.  **Changing Regulations:** The public sector is undergoing significant changes, including increased concessions. Recent examples include repealing FCC guidelines on net neutrality and challenges to the healthcare strengthening initiated during the Obama era. Regardless of varying viewpoints, these alterations signify a trend of defunding and altering public sector staples that has been ongoing since the 1980s.\n\n5.  **Impact on Future Generations:** These issues directly affect communication, information access, benefits, and education for younger generations. Millennials need to recognize their role in the public sector as it directly relates to the services they will inherit once the older generation transitions. This understanding is vital for shaping the future landscape of public services.\"",

        "description": " Small Business and Microenterprise\"The New York State Community Development Block Grant Program (NYS CDBG) is a federally funded program administered by the Housing Trust Fund Corporation's (HTFC) Office of Community Renewal (OCR). The Stand-alone Business Assistance and Microenterprise Development programs will provide resources to non-entitlement communities for the purpose of assisting for-profit businesses that create or retain permanent jobs that are principally held by or made available to low-moderate income persons.\n\n\n\nThe Office of Community Renewal recognizes that New York's smaller communities must have an economy that encourages business development and promotes jobs for low- and moderate-income persons.  Through the Office of Community Renewal's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Economic Development program, the Office of Community Renewal provides grants to communities that wish to sponsor economic development activities that create or retain jobs for low- and moderate-income persons.  The goal of the program is to fund projects that result in high quality, full-time jobs that are well paying and provide benefits and training to low- and moderate-income persons.\n\n\n\nThe NYS CDBG Economic Development program consists of three funding activities:  \n\nEconomic Development, Small Business Assistance, and Microenterprise.  Eligible applicants must apply on behalf of the business seeking CDBG funds. Awards are made to the applicant community and not directly to businesses.  Economic development funds are flexible and can be used for most legitimate business purposes.  \n\n  \n\nThe CDBG Economic Development, Small Business Assistance, and Microenterprise Applications operate through an Open Round process in the Consolidated Funding Application (CFA) portal. The Open Round applications involve a two-step process. First, an applicant must complete a preliminary application called the Pre-Submission Form. The Pre-Submission Form will be reviewed by the Office of Community Renewal. If the Pre-Submission form meets CDBG program requirements, the applicant will receive a formal invitation to apply. The invitation to apply will allow the applicant to proceed to the second step, the full application. An applicant must complete the full application in the CFA portal within 60 days of the invitation to apply.  \n\n  \n\nThe Open Round process for CDBG Economic Development, Small Business Assistance, and Microenterprise do not share the CFA deadline. Open Round applications may be submitted throughout the year. A CFA request for CDBG Economic Development, Small Business, or Microenterprise Assistance cannot include requests for other funding sources within the same application.\n\n\n\nApplicants for NYS CDBG funds are required to meet Citizen Participation requirements by issuing a public notice and holding a public hearing **prior to submitting an application**.  Evidence of these requirements is a threshold item for application eligibility. \n\n\n\nProject activities **must not** commence prior to award **and** approval of environmental materials by the Office of Community Renewal.\n\n\n\nThere are three funding categories under the NYS CDBG Economic Development Program: (1) **Economic Development,** (2) **Small Business Assistance,** and (3) **Microenterprise.**\n\n\n\n**Economic Development** and **Small Business** funds are available to municipalities to assist for-profit businesses to create or retain permanent employment, primarily for persons of low- and moderate-income. **Microenterprise** funds are available to municipalities to create opportunities for the development of businesses within 5 or fewer employees, including the owner, that promote employment opportunities for persons of low-to-moderate income.\"",

The purpose of this grant is to stimulate new and innovative efforts that support pre-professionalization, encourage communication and collaboration across diverse groups of graduate students, and build communities amongst graduate student medievalists. Examples of such projects include: a graduate student conference; an online journal; a lecture or workshop series; a collective excursion to an archive, museum, architectural or archaeological site; performances (of medieval music, medieval drama, etc); or the creation of collaborative digital humanities projects, to name but several possibilities. This grant is therefore intended to support a wide range of activities by investing in the merits of innovative new approaches that simultaneously build professional communities and promote research, publication, and teaching.  \n\n  \n\nAwards will be based on detailed grant proposals adjudicated by the Academy's Committee on Professional Development in consultation with the GSC Chair. Recipients will be required to submit a progress report to the Academy and to the GSC and will be invited to present their activities and findings at a special MAA GSC panel at Kalamazoo, Leeds, or the MAA Annual Meeting. Preference will be given to projects that clearly demonstrate a level of practical professionalization, contributing in some form to the development of skilled research, teaching, or publication that prepares graduate students for success and advancement in academic careers. The feasibility of implementation within 12 months, the promotion strategy, and a demonstrated need for the grant in order to complete the project successfully are also important factors in the evaluation. In general, one (1) grant of $2,000 will be awarded, but the award may be divided among multiple projects at the discretion of the adjudication committee.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: HRSA-23-041  \nThe Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) is a multi-year Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) initiative aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality of substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid use disorder (OUD), in high-risk rural communities. This notice announces the opportunity to apply for funding under the RCORP-Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health (RCORP-CABH) program. The purpose of RCORP-CABH is to establish and expand sustainable behavioral health care services for children and adolescents aged 5-17 years who live in rural communities, and to prevent substance misuse. For the purposes of RCORP-CABH, \"behavioral health\" encompasses services to address both mental health and substance use disorders. Over the four-year period of performance, award recipients will use RCORP-CABH funding to achieve the following three program goals through a consortium-based approach1: Goal 1: Service Delivery. Establish new behavioral health prevention, treatment, and recovery services for children and adolescents aged 5-17 years in the target rural service area. Goal 2: Training and Peer Mentorship. Improve the capacity of rural health care providers, paraprofessionals, non-clinical staff, and community members to care for and support children and adolescents aged 5-17 with behavioral health needs, through providing training and peer mentorship opportunities. Goal 3: Community Partnerships. Build community partnerships to ensure that children and adolescents, and their families, have access to community resources and human services that support prevention of, treatment of, and recovery from behavioral health disorders. As a result of these goals, HRSA expects that an increased number of children and adolescents aged 5-17 will receive evidence-based, coordinated behavioral health care and supportive services. Additionally, HRSA expects that all activities implemented under RCORP-CABH will be sustainable by the end of the four-year period of performance. The target population for RCORP-CABH is: - Children and adolescents ages 5-17 in HRSA-designated rural counties and rural census tracts who are at risk for, have, or are recovering from a behavioral health disorder; - The families and caretakers of children and adolescents ages 5-17 in HRSA-designated rural counties and rural census tracts who are at risk for, have, or are recovering from a behavioral health disorder. HRSA encourages you to include populations that have historically suffered from poorer health outcomes, health disparities, and other inequities as compared to the rest of the population. Examples of these populations include, but are not limited to racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, new immigrants, people who are homeless, and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, HRSA expects applicants to ensure that all activities supported by RCORP-CABH are culturally and linguistically appropriate for the target rural population that will be served.\"",

        "description": "\"**Purpose**\nTo promote continuing education at institutions of higher learning. Priority will be given to a student who volunteers with Hopewell Fire & Rescue or is a dependent of a current or former employee/member of the Hopewell Fire & Rescue Department. Preference may also be given to individuals interested in pursuing a course of study in the medical field or receiving appropriate training as a full-time or part-time firefighter or emergency services provider.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Hopewell Fire Department retirees, employees and members established the Hopewell Fire and Rescue Retiree Scholarship Endowment through the John Randolph Foundation in October 2017. Hopewell Fire Department has enjoyed many years of working together with John Randolph Foundation to provide emergency and safety service enhancements to the citizens of Hopewell and surrounding localities. Grants received from John Randolph Foundation over the years, have enabled Hopewell Fire Department to acquire much needed medical and safety equipment such as an emergency boat, funding to refurbish and purchase a new ambulance and provided equipment for cardiac arrest victims. Hopewell Fire Department is deeply grateful to John Randolph Foundation as a community partner and the impact their funding has had on the many services and safety programs provided by Hopewell Fire Department. This translates in our ability to maintain a high level of service to our community. Hopewell Fire Department has always had an interest in the youth of our City. We implemented a program to bring monthly training to all fourth graders in Hopewell. Members of the Department would attend each fourth-grade class in the city to teach and acquaint them with knowledge and measures to ensure their safety at home as well as at school. Members of the Fire Department would also teach fire and rescue practices to encourage the youth and local citizens to be interested in making the fire service their career. The establishment of the Hopewell Fire and Rescue Retirees Scholarship Endowment is just another way that the Hopewell Fire Department retirees and employees/members wish to give back to the youth of the city and surrounding localities. It is important for the retirees and members of Hopewell Fire and Rescue to aid the students in becoming members of the Fire and EMS service. We are committed to this scholarship fund and are willing to further interested persons education to become exceptional providers.\"",

        "title": "\"iX Challenge: Improved Operational Decision-Making Tools for Offshore Wind Farm Maintenance\"",
        "description": "\"Efficient operation of offshore wind farms is essentialWind farm servicing and maintenance is either scheduled or unscheduled. Routine servicing and maintenance is required on a regular basis and is driven by component-specific requirements. Unscheduled maintenance is required due to failure or damage of a component.\n\n\n\nWhere possible, any works that can be forecast and scheduled into routine visits, vastly reduce the cost of Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Combining this with an understanding of weather and future energy yield can offer great insight to an operator trying to optimise energy production on site.\n\n\n\nPlanning of maintenance works remains a largely manual process in many cases, with staff using available data from multiple sources to make subjective decisions on optimal maintenance processes. Whilst experienced staff can be very accurate in this manual planning process, with a future pipeline of complex offshore wind sites, which must operate on tighter margins, there is a need to move towards holistic, accurate and consistent objective planning systems.\n\n\n\n**Challenge**  \n\n\n\nThe challenge is to deliver a cost-effective method to improve the decision-making process for offshore logistics and work planning at operational offshore wind farms.\n\n\n\n**Proposals are welcome for cost-effective solutions in a variety of forms, including:**\n\n\n\n-  Data driven methods to target offshore visits effectively \n\n-  Decision making capabilities based on live production forecasting & weather inputs \n\n-  Scheduling which maximises production of the wind turbine \n\n\n\nChosen solutions may be invited to trial at SSER sites and if trials prove successful could see uptake for maintenance planning across SSER sites.\n\n\n\n[Wood Mackenzie](https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/global-offshore-wind-om-market-to-grow-16-annually-to-us$12-billion-by-2029/) established that the offshore wind O&M market will grow 16% annually to US$12 billion (£9.69 billion) by 2029. A conservative 1% saving on O&M costs would imply an annual market size of £96.9m by 2029, representing a large opportunity for a successful solution provider.\n\n\n\n**Entrants to this competition must be:**\n\n\n\n-  Established businesses, start-ups, SMEs or individual entrepreneurs \n\n-  UK based or have the intention to set up a UK base \n\n\n\nPartnerships and consortia of organisations are welcome to apply to this competition.\"",

        "description": " Mortality & Cognitive Decline Treatment Strategies - Bachelor's level\"The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) is the Department of Defense's lead laboratory for medical chemical defense research. As a subordinate element of the U.S. Army Medical Development and Materiel Command (USAMRDC), the institute conducts research for development of medical countermeasures to treat exposure to various chemical threat agents for protection of soldiers and civilians. Scientific disciplines at USAMRICD include, but are not limited to, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology, neuroscience, toxicology, physiology, psychology, and immunology. Visit us on Facebook at [www.facebook.com/USAMRICD](http://www.facebook.com/USAMRICD).\n\n\n\n**Why should I apply and what will I be doing?**\n\n\n\nFuture multi-domain operations (MDO) against near-peer adversaries will likely deny air superiority which can interrupt medical evacuation. In such an environment, improving prolonged field care (PFC) using medical supplies already on hand is an increasing priority. There is a critical need in the treatment of polytraumas in general but also specifically those resulting from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and simultaneous deployment of chemical warfare nerve agent (CWNA). Both TBI and CWNA exposure are complicated individual injury states that, when combined, can present treatment challenges in austere environments. Additional information about how casualties with TBI and CWNA should be managed during PFC scenarios is required to reduce morbidity and mortality in the field.\n\n\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, you will primarily partake in a Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP) funded project with a multidisciplinary research team to investigate treatment strategies that mitigate seizure activity, mortality, and cognitive decline and to improve neuroprotection strategies using a transgenic KIKO mouse model to validate metrics to determine treatment efficacy. This research project involves small animal surgery, passive behavioral studies, and evaluation of electroencephalographic (EEG) records, stereology, histology, tissue dissection, and analysis of data. You are also highly encouraged to present your research at annual research conferences, scientific society meetings and other venues.\n\n\n\nIn addition, you will have the opportunity to participate in several other projects in two main research areas in another laboratory at the USAMRICD:\n\n\n\n1) Development of a human-relevant small animal model for the testing of countermeasures for nerve agent intoxication.\n\n\n\n2) Identification and/or design of novel small molecules for the reversal of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by organophosphorus nerve agents (the main cause of nerve agent intoxication).\n\n\n\nThroughout this research opportunity, you will be given the tools to learn new techniques. These include but are not limited to animal handling techniques, various forms of microscopy, EEG analysis, small animal surgery, novel polytrauma model development, standard mouse breeding practices, characterization of genetically modified mice, as well as learn a variety of in vitro techniques including PCR genotyping and biochemical enzyme activity assays. Additionally, you will learn to prepare detailed methods and results sections of experiments for publication in scientific journals, maintain laboratory chemicals and supplies, and develop slides, graphs, and posters for presentation. This research opportunity caters to those interested in pursuing career opportunities in the biotech or biomedical industries, or who plan to attend graduate/medical/veterinary schools.\n\n\n\n**Where will I be located?**\n\n\n\nAberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland\n\n\n\n**What is the appointment length?**\n\n\n\nUSAMRICD is prepared to begin this appointment as soon as possible and will review applications on an ongoing basis until a candidate is selected. This appointment is a twelve month research appointment, with the possibility to be renewed for additional research periods. Appointments may be extended depending on funding availability, project assignment, program rules, and availability of the participant.\n\n\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n\n\nYou will receive a stipend to be determined by USAMRICD. Stipends are typically based on a participant's academic standing, discipline, experience, and research facility location.\n\n\n\nOther benefits may include the following:\n\n\n\n-  Health Insurance Supplement (*Participants are eligible to purchase health insurance through ORISE*)\n\n-  Relocation Allowance\n\n-  Training and Travel Allowance\n\n\n\n**About ORISE**\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and DoD. Participants do not enter into an employee/employer relationship with ORISE, ORAU, DoD or any other office or agency. Instead, you will be affiliated with ORISE for the administration of the appointment through the ORISE appointment letter and Terms of Appointment. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

        "description": "\"**Description**\n**Research Topic Description, including Problem Statement:**\n\n\n\nThe properties and dynamics of mixed aerosol particles depend on their phase, chemical composition, and morphology. The rates of reactions strongly depend on whether the condensed-phase reacting substances are available on the particle surface or obscured by non-reactive substances, or fully encapsulated by a protective shell. In particular, the chemical and physical processes associated with secondary organic aerosol (SOAs) formation are complex and varied with several knowledge gaps remaining. SOAs account for a significant fraction of ambient aerosols and so an understanding of their formation, properties, and dynamics is needed to address both climate change and human health. Additionally, accurate identification of aerosols in complex environments is vital to national security as many chemical threats are, or could be, delivered as aerosols. Understanding the role of particle morphology in the properties and dynamics of aerosols is critical to assessing threats in a timely manner. This solicitation seeks an approach for characterizing the morphology of aerosol particles to study how that effects chemical reaction dynamics and physical changes.\n\n\n\n**Example Approaches:**\n\n\n\nThe focus of this effort is on developing an understanding of the role morphology plays in reaction dynamics of particle mixtures. Approaches may include experimental methods and/or computational approaches (compared to available experimental data for validation wherever possible). Relevant data and techniques may include aerosol mass spectrometry, electron resonance spectroscopy, photochemical aging processes, or other approaches. Variables to be considered include chemical composition, temperature variation, humidity levels, and particle formation methods. \n\n\n\n**Relevance to the Intelligence Community (IC):**\n\n\n\nDevelop/enhance capabilities to detect and identify chemical agents, and associated delivery systems. Develop/enhance capabilities to rapidly characterize the release of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and/or related hazardous materials. Develop/enhance capabilities to conduct detailed sampling and chemical analysis across all states of matter.\"",

        "title": "\"Limited Competition for the NIDDK Short-Term Research Experience Program to Unlock Potential (STEP-UP) (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-DK-22-510  \nThe NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the NIH Institutes and Centers. \n\n\n\nThe overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research.\n\n\n\nThis National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) R25 program is designed to support educational activities that enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce involved in NIDDK research mission areas including diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this NOFO will support creative educational activities with a primary focus on:\n\n\n\n-  **Research Experiences:** For example, for high school students the goal is to provide exposure to a research experience to encourage students to consider majoring in science related disciplines in college. \n\n-  **Mentoring Activities:** For example, dedicated efforts at providing not only technical expertise, but advice, insight, and professional career skills to high school students. This would include checking in with participants through a variety of methods including the use of different mentoring material, webinars, video conferences and other follow-up after the summer research experience for at least 9 months. \n\n\n\nNIDDK's Short-Term Research Experience to Unlock Potential (STEP-UP) program is focused on encouraging the participation of students from diverse backgrounds, including students from groups underrepresented in biomedical research on a national basis, such as individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with disabilities to pursue careers in biomedical research. (See [NOT-OD-20-031, Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)). The overall STEP-UP program encourages participation through providing research experiences and follow-up mentoring to both high school and undergraduate students, notably this limited competition notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is only for high school students. This program provides students with hands-on research experience early in their academic career and the opportunity to participate in biomedical research in the NIDDK mission areas. This limited competition NOFO is intended to support a coordinating center that will operate a high school program located in one of the following geographic areas where there has been low participation in the STEP-UP program to date in the following states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri (referred to as Region C).\n\n\n\nThe NIDDK's mission is to conduct and support medical research and research training and to disseminate science-based information on disease including diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases; and it is of the highest importance that the entire US population is engaged in this research and work.\n\n\n\n**Need for the Program**\n\n\n\nPromoting diversity in the extramural scientific workforce is critical to the success of the NIH mission and is consistent with the mandates of the [21st Century Cures Act](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-101.html). Every facet of the United States scientific research enterprise-from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation-requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIH's ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further NIH's mission.\n\n\n\nResearch shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.\n\n\n\nIn spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences, such as the groups noted in the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031. The severity of the under-representation of these groups increases throughout the training stages. For example, students from certain racial and ethnic groups, including Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos/Latinas, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders comprise ~39 percent of the college age population, but earn only ~17 percent of bachelor's degrees and ~13 percent of Ph.D. degrees in the life sciences ([National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/data-tools.cfm)).\n\n\n\nThese findings highlight the need for both training activities that encourage participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups in biomedical research and programming that help to encourage individuals to pursue science-related careers. Moreover, studies have shown the beneficial nature of research programs similar to STEP-UP in terms of improving academic outcomes and fueling interest in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields ([Science. 2007 Apr 27;316(5824):548-9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17463273/); [Eth Dis. 2020 Jan 16;30(1):5-14.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969778/)). This NOFO is needed to promote diversity in the biomedical research workforce by providing research opportunities and follow-up mentoring early in the academic career for high school students. Though the STEP-UP program has spurred opportunities throughout the country and US territories, over the past 10 years there have been very few high school participants from the following states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. As a result of the lack of participation, this NOFO seeks to support a Coordinating Center located in one of the listed states to serve as the conduit for outreach and research coordination for the program.\n\n\n\n**Programmatic Approach of STEP-UP**\n\n\n\nFor this NOFO, the Coordinating Center (CC) will operate a high school program for students from diverse backgrounds, including students from underrepresented groups, who are at least 16 years old and either in the 11th or 12th grades at the time of application.\n\n\n\nUnder this Limited Competition NOFO, one CC will be awarded to coordinate recruitment of high school students across the following states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri (referred to as Region C). The awarded CC will work with NIDDK program staff and other funded centers in outreach, recruitment, and research placements in the states mentioned above.\n\n\n\nThe CC is expected to support 25 participants annually and will manage all aspects of placement, mentoring and follow-up of students in disparate locations in Region C. NIDDK recommends that the CC uses innovative methods in terms of recruitment, outreach and mentoring and applicants should describe how they plan to do this.\n\n\n\nApplicants must develop the process for identifying and matching research mentors with students, along with strategies to continuously build the cadre of research mentors throughout the duration of the program. For the high school program, the CC finds research placement sites for the selected students in locations geographically near to the student's residence. Centers are encouraged to use their research networks to develop potential research mentors for students. Students may, but are not required to, do their summer research at the coordinating center's institution.\n\n\n\nThe program provides support for high schoolers in research training for 8 consecutive weeks over the summer (May to August) in NIDDK mission areas. At the end of the summer, all students in the program are required to attend a scientific symposium to present results from their research experience; the scientific symposium is typically held on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n\n\nA key component of this NOFO is also ensuring that students receive both follow-up and mentorship for nine calendar months following the completion of their summer research experience. Centers are encouraged to propose novel low-cost mentoring methods and the use of technology, social media and other dissemination methods for both outreach and building a community among participants in disparate locations. This NOFO does not support the development of websites or other apps for the application process, as the NIDDK already provides these resources to students and the centers. This NOFO does not provide monetary support for the development of residential summer research programs where all participants stay in the same dormitory on the same university or institution campus.\n\n\n\nSee Section VI. Award Administration Information, 4. Evaluation for a list of key questions/metrics used to determine whether the program goals or outcomes have been met in a future evaluation.\n\n\n\nThroughout the program, NIDDK will actively monitor the progress of the STEP-UP program to determine if the results meet the goal of providing research experiences and opportunities to be mentored for high school students and encourage the participation of students from diverse backgrounds, including students from underrepresented groups in the biomedical research workforce (see, e.g., [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)). The CCs will hold annual meetings together with NIDDK program staff to analyze progress and process and to determine if changes should be made.\n\n\n\nResearch education programs may complement ongoing research training and education occurring at the applicant institution, but the proposed educational experiences must be distinct from those training and education programs currently receiving Federal support. R25 programs may augment institutional research training programs (e.g., T32, T90) but cannot be used to replace or circumvent Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) programs.\n\n\n\nThis NOFO aligns with the Mission and Vision of the [NIDDK Strategic Plan for Research](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/strategic-plans-reports/niddk-strategic-plan-for-research), including the theme of empowering a multidisciplinary workforce, engaging diverse stakeholders, and pursuing pathways to health for all. Specifically, this FOA aligns with the Scientific goals 1.4 and 2.2 and Cross-cutting topics of strengthening biomedical research workforce diversity and training as found in the Strategic Plan.\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to this NOFO**\n\n\n\n**Applications must come from a Region C state: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. Applications that do not come from any of these states will not be considered responsive to this NOFO. Applications that propose to include a plan to develop websites or other apps for a participant's application process will not be considered responsive for this NOFO. Applications that aim to recruit undergraduate students will not be considered responsive. Non-responsive applications submitted to this NOFO will be withdrawn without review.**\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\"",

        "description": "\"**Funding Opportunity Number:** DE-FOA-0003244\nCurrent nuclear glovebox manufacturers do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet the DOE/NNSA's anticipated glovebox demand through 2035. The demand is driven principally by the magnitude and timing of gloveboxes required by the Los Alamos Plutonium Pit Production Project (LAP4) and the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility (SRPPF).\n\n\n\nOther projects, across NNSA, DOE, DoD, commercial industry, and the United Kingdom s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) also require gloveboxes in significant quantities and may compete with NNSA's programs for glovebox design and fabrication.\n\n\n\nTo meet its mission, \"to protect the Nation, our allies and our partners by providing a resilient and responsive Nuclear Security Enterprise,\" the DOE/NNSA must sometimes rely on commercial manufacturers to help meet important mission objectives. In late 2022, the DOE/NNSA determined the need to ensure a sufficient supply of gloveboxes is available for necessary capital projects and equipment replacements and installations within designated facilities. After extensive market research and in coordination Energy Facility Contractors Group (EFCOG), the DOE/NNSA developed a Strategic Action Plan to coordinate efforts of federal management & operating (M&O) partners across technical, fiscal, contracting, and industrial base domains to create a coherent approach that uses all levers to meet prioritized mission requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Strategic Action Plan directed the Matrixed Execution Team (MET) Glovebox Working Group to pursue cost sharing grants for glovebox manufacturing expansion. To meet this directed action, the DOE/NNSA seeks cooperative agreement applications for the Glovebox Manufacturing Expansion Initiative (GMEI).  Funding will support investments in facility expansion and equipment modernization of commercial facilities in the United States for the fabrication of Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA-1) or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 nuclear gloveboxes. Applications must identify achievable expansion goals to meet the following:\n\n\n\nDouble current manufacturing capacity no later than December 31, 2028\n\nApplicants should be prepared to show how facility expansion and/or equipment purchases will increase (at least double) their manufacturing capability no later than December 31, 2028.

        "title": "\"Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) - 40125b Cybersecurity for Research",
        "description": " Development**A. Background and Context**\n\n\n\nThe Department of Energy's (DOE s) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), on behalf of the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) program, is issuing this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Awards made under this FOA will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act1, more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).\n\n\n\nThe BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in modernizing and upgrading American infrastructure to enhance United States competitiveness, drive the creation of good-paying union jobs, tackle the climate crisis, and ensure stronger access to economic, environmental, and other benefits for disadvantaged communities2. BIL appropriates more than $62 billion to the Department of Energy (DOE)3 to invest in American manufacturing and workers; expand access to energy efficiency and clean energy; deliver reliable, clean and affordable power to more Americans; and demonstrate and deploy the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations.\n\n\n\nDOE s BIL investments will support efforts to build a clean and equitable energy economy that achieves a zero-carbon electricity system by 2035, and to put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 20504 to benefit all Americans.\n\n\n\nBIL will invest appropriations of $250 million over a 5-year period from FY 2022 through 2026 to develop advanced cybersecurity applications and technologies for the energy sector through several research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities aligned with the 40125(b) provision.\n\n\n\nThe activities to be funded under this FOA support a subset of the BIL sections\n\n40125(b) to Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) of applications and technologies for advanced cybersecurity in the energy sector to maximize the benefits of the clean energy transition as the nation works to curb the climate crisis, empower workers, and advance environmental justice.   This BIL section is focused on:\n\n-      Identifying and mitigating cybersecurity vulnerabilities\n\n-      Advancing the security of field devices and third-party control systems\n\n-      Leveraging electric grid architecture to assess risks to the energy sector\n\n-      Performing pilot demonstrations of new technologies\n\n\n\n**i. Program Purpose**\n\nThis FOA supports the Administration goals laid out above by funding RD&D projects to advance cybersecurity tools and technologies specifically designed to reduce cyber risks to renewable energy delivery infrastructure.  This effort will lead to next generation tools and technologies not available today that will become widely adopted throughout the energy sector to reduce a cyber incident disruption to energy delivery.\n\n\n\nAs part of the whole-of-government approach to advance equity and encourage worker organizing and collective bargaining,5, 6, 7 and in alignment with BIL sections 40125(b), this FOA and any related activities will seek to encourage meaningful engagement and participation of workforce organizations, including labor unions, as well as underserved communities and underrepresented groups, including Indian Tribes 8. Consistent with Executive Order 14008,9 this FOA is designed to help meet the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of the Administration s investments in clean energy and climate solutions be delivered to disadvantaged communities, as defined and identified by the CEJST pursuant to the Executive Order, and to drive creation of accessible, good-paying jobs with the free and fair chance for workers to join a union.\n\n\n\nDetailed technical descriptions of the specific Topic Areas are provided in the sections that follow.\n\n\n\n**B. Topic Areas**\n\n\n\nThis Announcement will support multi-year research, development, and demonstration of tools and technologies to reduce cyber risks to energy delivery infrastructure.  Applications must be structured to conduct research and development in phase one and demonstration in phase two, with a  go/no-go decision point between the phases.  The decision is based on performance of the phase one work and the likelihood and benefit of potential phase two work, with the goal to get these technologies into the market.\n\n\n\nThis Announcement includes four (4) Topic Areas. Only applications that specifically address a single Topic Area described in the following section will be accepted under this Announcement.  Reference Section III.F Number of Submittals Eligible for Review.\n\n\n\n**General Requirements**\n\n\n\nAll applications **must** address the following for all topic areas:\n\n\n\n-    Identify improvements over state of the art for the technology area.\n\n\n\n-    Identify how the solution is interoperable, scalable, and manageable and does not adversely impact critical energy delivery functions.\n\n\n\n-    Identify how the solution addresses the security objectives of availability, integrity, and confidentiality. Typically, availability and integrity are of higher priority in the energy sector.\n\n\n\n-    A demonstration of the developed solution needs to be performed to promote energy sector acceptance and to gain experience with new technologies.  A successful demonstration will lend confidence that the cybersecurity innovation will perform as expected, will reduce the risk that a cyber-incident could disrupt energy delivery, and will not interfere with the function of the energy delivery control system.\n\n\n\n-    Include a plan with an estimated timeline outlining a strategy and technical plan for transitioning solutions into practice for the energy sector through commercialization or by making the solution available through open source. Either approach will require the development of a comprehensive technology strategy that includes market research, distribution strategies, and deployment and scalability requirements.\n\n\n\n-    All proposals must address the potential impact to latency and availability of the system.\n\n\n\n-    All proposals to the topic areas below must include research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities.\n\n\n\n-    Teaming arrangement:\n\n    a. Establish an Industry Advisory Board (IAB) with members representing energy sector asset owners/operators and suppliers of energy delivery systems and components. The board members will provide inputs to ensure developed tools and technologies meet energy sector needs, and champion transition of the solutions into real-world energy systems. The board will perform the following functions:\n\n        i. Provide advisory input, \n\n        ii. Ensure project activities will be useful to energy sector asset owners/operators, and \n\n        iii. Approve the project demonstration site or testbed ensuring it accurately replicates  real-world  energy delivery operations.\n\n-    Independent third party to red team test the developed solution to evaluate the developed tool or technology for vulnerabilities and threat vectors.\n\n\n\n**i. Topic Area 1 - Address Forensic Analysis of Infected Renewable Systems**\n\n\n\nThe energy sector is a complex architecture containing a variety of field devices, such as renewable components (Photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines), smart meters, sensors and control systems. These devices may be located in physically unprotected areas that are accessible to potential adversaries. Many of the control systems are developed, operated, and maintained by third parties. The objective of this topic is to research, develop and demonstrate advanced cybersecurity applications and technology to enhance the capability to conduct forensic analysis of infected renewable energy systems and operational technology (OT) devices. Forensic analysis is the collection, analysis, and preservation of digital evidence to investigate a cyber-attack. This topic may require the development of specialized tools and techniques and/or the expansion of existing commercially available solutions to, for example, to determine the cause and source of a cyber-attack and to recover data such as deleted files.\n\n\n\n**ii. Topic Area 2   Enhancing Cybersecurity for Inverter-Based Resources**\n\n\n\nInverter-based resources (IBR) and their important role in delivering clean energy from Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to customers is resulting in IBRs becoming a new cyberattack vector.  IBRs typically include wind and solar generation technology and related energy storage/battery assets.  Innovative RD&D is needed that will result in solutions that will significantly advance the cybersecurity and reliable operation of IBRs and their power management systems. The objective of this topic is to research, develop and demonstrate advanced cybersecurity applications and technologies to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in various components of an IBR system including inverters, inverter controllers, and inverter control systems.\n\n\n\n**iii. Topic Area 3   Enhancing Communications Security for Distributed Energy Resource Aggregations (DERA)**\n\n\n\nUnder Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2222, distributed energy resource aggregations (DERA) can participate in the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and Independent System Operator (ISO) markets (RTO/ISO markets).  FERC Order No. 2222 defines a distributed energy resource (DER) as  small-scale power generation or storage technologies (typically from 1 kW to 10,000 kW) that can provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power system. These can be located on an electric utility s distribution system, a subsystem of the utility s distribution system or behind a customer meter. They may include electric storage, intermittent generation, distributed generation, demand response, energy efficiency, thermal storage or electric vehicles and their charging equipment.\"  A focus could also be on DERAs that could contain multiple types of DERs (i.e., combination wind, solar and storage) within the aggregation boundary. This topic area is requesting the development or expansion of secure communications between the DER and the DERA and between the DERA and RTO/ISOs. Secure communications include ensuring integrity of data and commands between the various sites. In addition, certain information may require safeguarding to ensure confidentiality. The deployment of secure communications is necessary to ensure operational stability, including availability, of the electric grid.\n\n\n\n**iv. Topic Area 4   Innovative Technologies that Enhance Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Cybersecurity**\n\n\n\nVirtual power plants are a connected aggregation of distributed energy resource (DER) technologies, offering a deeper integration of renewables providing cleaner and more affordable power.  Cybersecurity RD&D is necessary to reduce the cyber-risk for VPP to enable the secure operation and management of these systems.\n\n\n\nThe objective of this topic areas is to research, develop and demonstrate a tool or technology that reduces the cyber-risk for VPPs for increased infrastructure security and reliability. This topic area requests research to develop a tool or technology that reduces cyber-risk on VPP communication and control systems by automatically recognizing a cyber-attack and adapting operations to sustain critical actions while response actions mitigate the attack.\n\n\n\nAll work for projects selected under this FOA must be performed in the United States.

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: F23AS00284  \nFor more than two decades, the Klamath Basin has encountered numerous challenges due to ongoing drought conditions, limited water supply and diverse needs. The Interior Department, along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the Bureau of Reclamation and numerous other state and federal entities have sought collaborative solutions to address conditions that impact Tribes and other stakeholders who are intimately connected to the Klamath Basin. For Year 2 (FY 23) of its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funding opportunity for the Klamath Basin, the Service is soliciting project pre-proposals that advance restoration activities in the Klamath Basin of Southern Oregon and Northern California. During an Interior Department workshop on Klamath restoration funding opportunities on December 15, 2022, many Klamath Basin stakeholders expressed an interest in having federal agencies adopt a more efficient process for navigating the complexities of funding opportunities across the federal and state government. As an initial response to that request, the Service, in collaboration with the Interior Department and other federal and state partners, invites applicants to submit project pre-proposals for its Year 2 BIL Klamath Basin funding opportunity. This funding opportunity incorporates a two-step process. Step one involves submitting pre-proposals, which will be ranked and evaluated by the Service. For Step two, by invitation only, the Service request full-proposals from the highest ranked projects. Both the pre-proposal process and the by-invitation-only full-proposal process are described below. Potential for Leveraging and Coordinating Funding The Service recognizes that there will likely be more request for project funding, than what is available within the Service's Year 2 BIL funding opportunity. In an effort to leverage additional funds for high-ranking projects, the Service may share pre-proposal abstracts with other funding agencies and conservation partners in order to determine level of support, overlap with ongoing work, potential additional collaboration opportunities, and potential coordination of funds.\"",

Seek major advances toward a cure and not simply incremental research gains or incremental improvements for SCI patients\n\n2. Support research that tests novel hypotheses and/or advances innovative research approaches that could move the field of SCI research significantly toward discovering a cure for SCI.\n\nThe SCIRB s mission is to stimulate high-quality, innovative SCI research that will help promote treatment and a cure for SCI, including methods for reversing paralysis or restoring function caused by injury, or for minimizing or preventing damage occurring during acute phases of injury.To achieve this mission, the Program offers a portfolio of competitive research awards to support the New York State scientists and their collaborators from a variety of biomedical disciplines in initiating and pursuing such efforts. Information about the Program and SCIRB can be found at:https://www.wadsworth.org/extramural/spinalcord.\n\n\n\n**Purpose of the Funds**\n\nThe SCIRB wishes to stimulate the growth of SCI research and to accelerate the pace with which basic (preclinical) findings are translated into clinical benefits for spinal cord-injured persons. In addition, SCIRB wishes to fill fundamental gaps in knowledge that are barriers to scientific advances in SCI research. The goal is to expend $8.5 million for SCI research every State fiscal year. \n\nThe SCIRB welcomes basic, translational and clinical neurological research applications on topics bearing on its mission. Although the SCIRB has not formally developed a list of research priorities, projects targeting tissue regeneration, repair, or restoration of function through biomedical and bioengineering research are of strongest interest.\"",

        "title": "\"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Intermediate Patient Population Expanded Access (U01 Clinical Trial Required)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-NS-24-029  \nThe purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage grant applications for the conduct of scientific research utilizing data from expanded access (EA) for investigational drugs or biological products as described in [section 561 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=\\(title:21%20section:360bbb%20edition:prelim\\)). These applications will target [intermediate size populations of patients](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/expanded-access/expanded-access-categories-drugs-including-biologics) living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are not eligible for ongoing clinical trials for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of ALS (\"intermediate EA protocol for ALS\").\n\n\n\nProvision of the investigational drug or biological product under an intermediate EA protocol for ALS must not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval or otherwise compromise the potential development of medical products for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of ALS.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\n\nALS is a rapidly progressive, ultimately fatal, neurodegenerative disease *w*ith over 32,000 estimated cases in the United States (U.S.) or a prevalence rate of 9.9 per 100,000 U.S. population. The disease affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to weakness and wasting of most skeletal muscles including the diaphragm. There is considerable variability in the phenotypic presentation and progression of ALS although the mean survival of people with diagnosis of ALS from symptom onset is 3-5 years. To date, treatment options for ALS remain severely limited. There are four disease-modifying drugs that have been approved by the FDA. Three of those drugs are approved for all forms of ALS, and one of the drugs is approved for SOD1-linked, familial ALS. However, so far, these drugs only have modest effects on slowing progression of the disease, and there is no known treatment that prevents, halts or reverses the progression of ALS. Thus, the development of new effective treatments to prevent disease onset, make ALS a livable disease, or cure ALS is a pressing need.\n\n\n\nTo address this challenge, some people with ALS may be eligible to enroll in ongoing phase 3/efficacy clinical trials of investigational drugs and biological products in ALS. However, trial sponsors typically set inclusion criteria that restrict participation to only a subset of people with ALS to increase the likelihood of detecting efficacy with feasible sample size and trial duration. Thus, a potentially large segment of people with ALS may be ineligible to participate in clinical trials because they do not meet these inclusion criteria.\n\n\n\nEA, sometimes referred to as \"compassionate use\", was established to provide treatment access to investigational medical products (i.e., drugs, biological products, medical devices) for people with serious, life-threatening diseases like ALS when no comparable or satisfactory therapy is available to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition. This pathway is defined and regulated by the FDA (see [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access)). Further, the FDA has not yet determined if these products are safe and effective for their specific use. One requirement of the EA pathway is that providing the investigational medical product under EA must not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of a medical product for the EA use, or otherwise compromise its potential development. An intermediate-size patient population EA protocol is generally used when more than one patient will be treated with an investigational drug/biological product under the EA ([21 CFR 312.315](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=312.315)), and can involve hundreds or even thousands of patients if appropriate.\n\n\n\nSection 2 of the [Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3537/text) (ACT for ALS; P.L. 117-79) established a grant program for scientific research utilizing data from EA to investigational drugs for ALS.\n\n\n\n**Objective**\n\n\n\nThe objective of this NOFO is to support the conduct of scientific research utilizing data from intermediate-size patient population EA protocols for ALS (see [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/expanded-access/expanded-access-categories-drugs-including-biologics](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/expanded-access/expanded-access-categories-drugs-including-biologics)).\n\n\n\nApplicants should take note of the following special requirements and considerations:\n\n\n\n-  EA New Drug Application (IND):\n\n    -  A grant will not be awarded unless the applicant provides documentation such as a \"may proceed\" email or letter from the FDA prior to funding.\n\n    -  An intermediate-size patient population EA IND application must be submitted to the FDA by the day of submission of the grant application to the NINDS.\n\n-  The investigational drug or biological product must not be approved under a New Drug Application (NDA) or licensed under a Biologics License Application (BLA).\n\n-  Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the protocol and the informed consent document are not required at the time of application submission, but must be documented prior to funding and initiation of treatment of participants. As such, NINDS encourages investigators to begin these processes as early as possible.\n\n-  Applications must follow [NINDS guidelines for monitoring clinical trials.](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/apply-funding/application-support-library/clinical-research-guidelines/ninds-guidelines-monitoring-clinical-trials)\n\n-  The EA protocol will provide access to the investigational drug or biological product for people with ALS. The protocol must also generate data that will support research or development related to the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of ALS. A description of the scientific research goal(s) informed by these data could include the investigational drug's/biological product's effect on biomarkers related to the pathophysiology of ALS or target engagement, the collection of safety or outcome information, such as survival or other significant medical events (e.g., hospitalization or need for ventilatory support), or patient experience data that are not specifically tied to assessing efficacy.\n\n-  Applications are required to include a description of how the proposed EA program will not interfere with participant enrollment in ongoing clinical trials for investigational therapies for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of ALS.\n\n-  Funding for the EA protocol will continue until one of the following events: \n\n    -  Marketing authorization of the drug/biological product by the FDA\n\n    -  Withdrawal or termination of the IND for the investigational agent by the sponsor\n\n    -  Decision by the FDA to put the EA protocol on hold, e.g., should information emerge that alters the acceptability of the EA use\n\n    -  Scenarios such as: (a) failure to implement the study protocol, (b) a substantial shortfall in study participant follow-up, data reporting and dissemination, quality control, or other major breach of the protocol, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocol with which NINDS does not concur, (d) study participant safety or ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination, or (e) a change in the state of science that has a significant impact on the relevance of the question\n\n    -  The project period has ended. The consent process should clearly explain to the study participants that grant support for the EA protocol is limited to the project period.\n\n-  This NOFO strongly encourages the use of [common data elements](https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/sites/nindscde/files/Doc/ALS/CDEStartupResource_ALS.pdf) (CDEs). CDEs are data standards that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. \n\n-  This NOFO strongly encourages applications that include a plan for stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder engagement in clinical studies involves people with lived experiences (PWLE), health professionals, and the clinical research team working in active partnership at various levels across the continuum of clinical research. Applicants are strongly encouraged to establish relationships with PWLE(s) and/or advocacy groups and solicit their input (including during study design) on recruitment, the clinical meaningfulness of the question under study, the relevance of the proposed clinical outcomes, and approaches to minimizing the burden on study participants. Applicants are encouraged to facilitate continued respectful, equitable and bidirectional knowledge transfer during stakeholder engagement to build trust in communities that may be fearful of participating in clinical research because of stigmas and medical mistrust. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders in these ways may also improve participant retention and adherence to the study protocol.\n\n-  NINDS is committed to reducing the disproportionate burden of neurological disease borne by underserved groups of society, including racial and ethnic minority, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. People from racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by many medical conditions including ALS. Additionally, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are more likely to be at risk for poorer health outcomes. Therefore, ensuring appropriate inclusion of populations that experience health disparities is strongly encouraged. \n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the [Research Methods Resources](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/) website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\"",

        "title": "\"Academic Development of a Training Program for Good Laboratory Practices in High Containment Environments (U24) Clinical Trials Not Allowed\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-FD-23-002  \nFDA's Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) is a leader and active participant in the public health community and with the military defense community, helping to advance the development, evaluation, and approval of medical countermeasures to be used against threats involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) agents. In 2010, FDA launched its Medical Countermeasures initiative (MCMi) in response to a report by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the nation's emergency readiness improve our nation's capacity to respond faster and more effectively to CBRN threats or a naturally occurring emerging disease (e.g., COVID-19 and pandemic influenza). OCET was tasked with leading the implementation of the MCMi. OCET's activities are informed by the knowledge that protecting the civilian, the public, and the warfighter against CBRN agents is a national security priority. A significant area of engagement for OCET is its support of innovative science to advance CBRN countermeasure development with the goal of improving access to safe and effective medical countermeasures, should the need arise. These efforts are central to strengthening national preparedness and security.\n\n\n\nDeveloping medical countermeasures (MCMs) presents unique challenges. For example, limited exposure to threat agents, such as anthrax, often makes it difficult to generate the necessary data from traditional clinical trials to support regulatory review and decision-making. In some cases, clinical trials may not be feasible or are unethical. In these cases, it may be necessary to use data from adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies under regulations commonly known as the \"Animal Rule\". The Animal Rule' (21 CFR 314.600 for drugs; 21 CFR 601.90 for biological products) permits animal models to be used to test the effectiveness of a product when testing in humans is neither possible nor feasible. Under the \"Animal Rule,' FDA recommends that pivotal efficacy studies be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations (21 CFR parts 58). Biological threats, such as Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Variola virus, or Lassa fever virus, for which medical countermeasures are needed, require testing in high and maximum biosecurity level (BSL-4) laboratories. These laboratory environments pose daunting challenges to a researcher's ability to meet the standards of GLP regulations. There has been tremendous progress in the development of candidate interventions over the last decade. However, to date there is not a single facility that is capable of performing pivotal studies under GLP at BSL-4. To break the current choke point in the development process for interventions against agents requiring maximum containment, it will be critical for laboratories with BSL-4 capacity to receive the training and develop the capability necessary to routinely perform pivotal studies in accordance with GLP.\n\n\n\nOCET therefore seeks applicants who will assist in the effort to research ways to better design a robust, collaborative, and educational program using problem-based learning techniques designed to bring researchers and regulators together to educate each other on the challenges related to these issues and to identify solutions that are acceptable from both scientific and regulatory perspectives. Under this grant, a critical objective is to continue to research ways to deliver this educational program in order to better reach the wide community of stakeholders (research industry, academic, governmental, and international), to better ensure wider distribution of data quality assurance methods in high consequence conditions. By researching these methods, the research and scientific communities will be better able to implement and coordinate medical countermeasure research. The educational program envisioned under this grant should also adjust and update training objectives/methods/content in order to provide participants with training and best practices under the 5 key areas below:\n\n\n\n1\\. GLP Natural History Studies in BSL-4 Laboratories\n\n\n\nNatural history studies are performed to establish the dose of the disease agent, the route of exposure, and to study the pathogenicity of the disease agent in the animal model. Results of these studies help determine which animal model best describes the disease in humans. Examples of challenges in meeting GLP standards include appropriate data recording, record keeping, inspections, and equipment validation. Training on the development of strategies to meet GLP standards in high and maximum biocontainment laboratories can be realized when everyone has a common understanding of the challenges and standards. In such a case, the scientific validity and regulatory acceptance of a study can be ensured early on, reducing the need for repeat studies, thereby reducing the numbers of animals needed to address the scientific and regulatory objectives. Once the natural history of the disease in the animal model has been established, it can be used to test the efficacy of antibiotics, vaccine, or other therapies as described in the \"Animal Rule.'\n\n\n\n2\\. GLP Animal Efficacy Studies in BSL-4 Laboratories\n\n\n\nAnimal efficacy studies are performed in accordance with the \"Animal Rule' to test the effectiveness of a medical countermeasure against a specific threat agent in an animal model that best models the disease in humans. Results from these studies also help determine the dose of the medical countermeasure that will be effective in humans. \n\n\n\n3\\. Good Clinical Practices to maintain data quality in maximum containment infectious disease settings\n\n\n\nOver the course of the training program to date (2012-2022), FDA has regularly worked with grantees and SMEs in government, academia, and industry to identify and incorporate updated or additional guidance. This includes the additional of a training module to provide best practices during clinical trials undertaken in maximum containment environments (i.e. \"clinical sites\") or high consequence pathogen environments. This component elaborates on the challenges of maintaining data quality at clinical sites, and best practices for mitigating risks to data quality (such as appropriate data recording, record keeping, onsite training, and validation techniques). This course module, which was initiated during the prior grant (2017-2022) has been a successful addition to the program and will remain a priority for the next grant.\n\n\n\n4\\. One Health:\n\n\n\nOne Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach that works at the local, regional, national, and global levels to achieve optimal health outcomes for human, animal, and environmental domains. Because FDA is aware of the value of One Health in solving public health issues, FDA cultivated an agency-wide One Health Initiative in 2019. The dynamic landscape of CBRN events is seldom separate among human, animal, and their shared environment requiring a collaborative, multidisciplinary, and multisectoral approach to detect, prepare, prevent, and respond to CBRN threats. Naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate threats with CBRN agents have no boundaries and can adversely impact any habitat or geographical location presenting significant public health challenges in all three domains. Utilizing a diverse scientific undertaking to enhance agency regulatory decisions and relevancy of policy development, the One Health concept can be utilized to establish partnerships, share knowledge with internal and external stakeholders, and facilitate mechanisms that can inform the development, regulatory review, and use of medical countermeasures. FDA can also utilize the One Health concept to analyze and resolve health disparities relevant to pre-clinical and clinical studies for FDA-regulated MCM products for both human and animals. Considerations for socio cultural and socio economic factors have helped gain various perspectives to geographic variation of pathogens in animal and non animal sources to better understand the environment's relationship of various adverse impacts and outcomes of both animals and people. \n\n\n\n5\\. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility:\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI&A) is a concept supported within all levels of government to include FDA advocating for broader participation, more attention to diverse perspectives, and opportunities allowing equal and accessible provisions. Although DEI&A has been a public health concern for many years, the topic is still at a starting point, and discussions have only scratched the surface of its suitability for product development for underserved communities including MCMs. Research, technology, and innovation disparities that limit the generalizability of data are likely to widen racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender treatment gaps, health inequities, or unintentional harmful results. DEI&A adds to the robustness of data generated from studies which would otherwise limit public health progress with FDA-regulated products including MCMs. This is one reason why the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act was developed to ensure women and minorities were included in clinical research. Preclinical animal studies were not immune to underrepresentation. Therefore, in 2015, sex as a biological variable was extended to vertebrate animal studies to factor in sex differences in research design, analysis, and reporting. Embracing DEI&A concepts and practices greatly increases the scope of gaining new perspectives and finding resolutions to ongoing public health CBRN and emerging threat issues for underserved communities critical for regulatory science interpretations, validation, and generalizability of data generated. As health issues continue to emerge, DEI&A needs to continue expanding its applications in the MCM realm. \n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that both the content of these areas, and methods for training these areas, will evolve over the duration of the grant. As such, grantees will conduct research to tailor these objectives and identify methods/opportunities to enhance training over the course of the cooperative agreement. \n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"**Description**\nTheoretical studies are being pursued on the formation and evolution of stars and planetary systems in conjunction with observationally oriented investigations of young stellar objects. Research is being conducted on the following topics: (1) disk formation, chemistry and evolution, (2) the initial formation of primitive bodies (asteroids and comets) (3) the dynamics of the growth of terrestrial planets, both around single stars and within binary star systems, (4) accretion of solids and gas by giant planets, (5) the spectral signatures of young extrasolar planets, (6) interpretation of meteoritic data, and (7) the interaction of young stellar objects with their environments. The stage of nebula evolution prior to planet formation in which the first planetesimals (analogous to comets and primitive asteroids) formed is under intensive study using advanced two-phase (particle-gas) fluid dynamics codes running on Ames massively parallel computers. In all areas, close attention is paid to meteoritic evidence and a variety of outside collaborations are under way. We are studying the possible effects on primitive solar system material of episodic stellar accretion or outbursts using observationally constrained models.\n\n\n\n**Location:**  \n\nAmes Research Center  \n\nMoffet Field, California  \n\n\n\n**Field of Science:** Planetary Science  \n\n\n\n**Advisors:**  \n\nJeff Cuzzi  \n\njeffrey.cuzzi@nasa.gov  \n\n650-604-6343  \n\n\n\nPaul R.

All of their children completed college at a variety of institutions - a family achievement in which Frank and Jean took great pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir daughter, Janet Nash, made Saginaw her home with her marriage to Dr. Jack Nash. Janet was employed for 32 years by the Saginaw Public School District. She retired in 2010 as Principal at the Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy (SASA). Janet and Jack's two children (Frank and Jean's grandchildren) are both SASA alumni. It is this association with the Saginaw Public Schools' Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy that this scholarship is created.

        "description": "\"**Description**\n***Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.**\n\n\n\n**USDA FS Office/Lab and Location:** A research opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS), at the University of Idaho, associated with the US Forestry Sciences Lab located in Missoula, Montana.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency's mission and motivates their work across the agency. It's been there from the agency's very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** The student intern involved in this project will collaborate with state (Idaho Department of Fish and Game), federal (USDA Forest Service) and academic (University of Idaho and North Dakota State University) partners to collate GTSequencing (~250 SNPs) and RADsequencing (~50,000 SNPs) data sets. They will then compare overlapping SNP loci to test for genotyping concordance and conduct the following analyses for the endemic Yellowstone cutthroat trout and invasive rainbow trout in the Teton River:\n\n\n\n1.  Identify F1 and post-F1 hybrids\n\n2.  Estimate genetic diversity, population genetic structure and extent of introgression (backcrossing)\n\n3.  Identify associations between hybrid ancestry and landscape features (riverscape genetics)\n\n\n\nThe intern will be expected to collaborate well, interact with co-managers and stakeholders, conduct bioinformatic analyses, assist in any additional wet lab research, and derive their own hypotheses to test in this study. \n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:** As a result of this training, the intern will learn and improve on computational genetics and conservation genetics analyses. These skills will include, but not be limited to, learning to use statistical coding languages (R, bash), generate genetic pipelines for genotyping samples and working with diverse collaborators on conservation genetic research questions.\n\n\n\n**Mentor:** The mentor for this opportunity is Alexandra Fraik ([Alexandra.Fraik@usda.gov](mailto:Alexandra.Fraik@usda.gov)). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 1, 2024.** Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for 11 weeks but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n**Participant Stipend:** The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. \n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the [Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details](https://orise.orau.gov/usfs/applicants/default.html) page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USFS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA FS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program.

The section is the official ionospheric research component of the USAF and USSF.\n\n\n\nOwing to changes in the geopolitical climate, AFRL and operators in the USSF and USAF have recognized the need to increase investment in middle-to-high latitude ionospheric irregularity research and development.

        "title": "\"Mechanisms that Impact Cancer Risk after Bariatric Surgery (R01 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-21-331  \n**Purpose**\n\n\n\nThrough this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) invites applications for support of investigator-initiated studies addressing mechanisms by which bariatric surgery impacts cancer risk, and seeks to draw in talented scientists who study bariatric surgery to investigate its effects on cancer, rather than shorter-term outcomes such as weight loss and diabetes.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\n\n*Obesity*: Obesity will soon surpass smoking tobacco as the number one cause of preventable death both in the United States and worldwide. Bariatric (metabolic) surgery is the most effective strategy to achieve significant initial and sustained weight loss among individuals who are morbidly obese. Bariatric surgery provides dramatic improvement in metabolic function, associated with a reduction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Bariatric surgery also appears to reduce the risk of certain obesity-related cancers, although which cancers are favorably impacted vary by study, and the mechanism(s) driving this risk reduction is mostly speculative. Bariatric surgery is performed in over 250,000 people in the U.S. annually, and the frequency is rising. Studies evaluating which bariatric surgery procedure(s) are most effective in cancer risk reduction could help bring to light new pathways to target for cancer prevention.\n\n\n\n*Bariatric Surgery*: Importantly, it is not yet clear from clinical and preclinical studies if the benefit from bariatric surgery arises from weight loss alone or if there is also a surgery-specific benefit. One mechanism for a possible surgery-specific effect is elevated bile acids (BA), both intestinal and circulating, after gastric bypass surgery such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) that are proposed to be central to weight loss and other metabolic benefits. The interaction between BA and intestinal microbes is also an area of intense interest. Studies have identified important changes after bariatric surgery in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which may mediate bariatric surgery effects. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from humans or mice that had undergone bariatric surgery to germ-free recipient mice showed decreased weight gain and decreased adiposity are both transmissible traits. In addition, FMT induced important host metabolic changes including decreased energy harvest from the diet, increased resting energy expenditure, and increased lipid utilization. The data suggest a causal link between gut microbiota and the metabolic and weight loss effects of bariatric surgery. If validated, the findings will provide insight into the mechanisms driving the benefit of bariatric surgery on cancer risk and would be useful to further scientific understanding and patient care.\n\n\n\n*Animal Models*: Several diets or genetically induced animal models of obesity have consistently demonstrated the benefits of weight loss on cancer risk, and these obesity-induced tumor models may be adaptable to bariatric surgery studies, such as the Kras model of pancreatic cancer. Animal models have been developed to study the effects of bariatric surgery. Rodent animal models are most often used due to feasibility (low cost, ease of housing) and have been used extensively to study the mechanism(s) of bariatric surgery responsible for the reduction or elimination of T2DM and CV risk. However, very little has been reported on bariatric surgery and cancer risk despite the fact that both rat and murine models of mammary and other cancers develop in 6 months or less, making it feasible to assess mechanistic changes that influence cancer risk.\n\n\n\n*Bariatric Surgery and Cancer Risk*: Obese patients undergo bariatric surgery for a variety of reasons, including weight loss and improvement in metabolic dysfunction. Physician advice regarding the potential benefit of bariatric surgery and cancer risk reduction can currently only be given in generalities based on large-scale studies and not targeted to the individual. Many but not all bariatric surgery investigations document an overall cancer risk reduction among women but not men. Some but not all bariatric surgery studies have found that both women and men undergoing bariatric surgery have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Older studies which assessed bariatric surgery and cancer risk may not be useful to guide targeted advice to patients, as one of the most common procedures performed in the past, gastric banding, is only performed in 1% of bariatric surgery procedures today. The two most common bariatric surgery procedures currently performed are sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB. As such, planned animal and/or human studies should focus on the mechanistic effects of the two procedures that are currently in common use. Human biospecimens and/or data may be available from cohorts to enhance the studies proposed including the [Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS)](https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/studies/labs/?query=labs), [Adolescent Bariatrics: Assessing Health Benefits & Risks (Teen-LABS)](https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/studies/teen-labs/?query=labs), and [NCI Cohort Consortium Members](https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/cohort-consortium/members/).\n\n\n\nApplications that include collaborators from fields outside of cancer research will be given special programmatic consideration. Responsive applications may investigate animal models, human studies, or a combination of both.\n\n\n\n**General Area of Research and Scope of Work for this FOA**\n\n\n\n**General Area of Research**\n\n\n\n*Examples of relevant areas of research include but are not limited to:*\n\n\n\n-  Do alterations in cancer risk biomarkers occur before weight loss? If so, in what organ, tissue, or cell type do they originate?\n\n-  Is maximum weight loss or long-term weight loss more important for cancer risk reduction? If so, how do the two differ at a cellular and/or biochemical level?\n\n-  What mechanism(s) explain the evidence that bariatric surgery is more beneficial in cancer risk reduction in women than men?\n\n-  Does bariatric surgery increase or decrease the risk of CRC, and if so, what are the mechanism(s)?\n\n-  Which cancers are decreased in incidence by bariatric surgery, and what are the mechanism(s) that explain the effect?\n\n-  Are any cancers increased in incidence by bariatric surgery? If so, through what mechanism(s)?\n\n-  Does the specific bariatric surgery procedure have an impact on cancer risk? If so, what are the mechanism(s) driving the difference in impact?\n\n-  Does racial or ethnic background influence the impact of bariatric surgery on cancer risk, and if so, what are the mechanism(s) involved?\n\n-  How does bariatric surgery affect the penetrance of high-risk genetic predisposition to cancer?\n\n\n\n**Scope of Work and Additional Guidance**\n\n\n\nIt is anticipated that studies will evaluate bariatric surgery animal models where a significant proportion of the animals develop cancer. Similarly, human studies involving individuals who will or have undergone bariatric surgery are also encouraged, so long as within the cohort to be studied the number of enrolled subjects who develop cancer is adequate to for a statistically powered endpoint linking cancer (and not a biomarker of cancer) to a molecular mechanism as the driver of cancer. When appropriate and feasible, the investigators may want to evaluate mechanisms influenced by bariatric surgery in animal models of cancer and evaluate potential changes that might correlate with humans due to bariatric surgery.\n\n\n\nWe define \"mechanism\" as a biologic endpoint based on analyzed samples from bariatric surgery animal models or from subjects who have or are planned to undergo bariatric surgery. This FOA does not support studies where an epidemiologic endpoint is the primary aim of the project. The mechanism(s) to be studied should evaluate samples collected from animals or humans who have undergone bariatric surgery who did or did not develop cancer. If both animals and humans are studied, the mechanisms chosen should be based on a cancer endpoint.\n\n\n\n**Applications Not Responsive to This FOA**\n\n\n\nThe following types of activities remain outside the scope of this FOA, and applications proposing them are non-responsive to this FOA and will not be reviewed.\n\n\n\n-  This FOA is not intended for epidemiologic studies, where the primary endpoint is the assessment of cancer in a cohort of animals or humans, which has undergone bariatric surgery and mechanistic studies evaluating bodily fluid or tissue samples are nonexistent or of secondary endpoints.\n\n-  Application that focuses entirely on in vitro investigations.\n\n-  Epidemiologic investigations as the primary focus of the application.\n\n-  Animal or human studies that do not evaluate tissue and/or bodily fluid samples collected from participants who have undergone bariatric surgery, some of which developed cancer after surgery.\n\n-  Application, which includes a clinical trial that does not have a bariatric surgeon as a key investigator on the team.\n\n\n\n**NOTE:** Applicants to this FOA are strongly encouraged to contact NCI staff as soon as possible in the development of the application (preferably no later than 12 weeks prior to the application due date) to discuss the details of their proposed clinical trial, so that NCI staff can help the applicant understand whether the proposed clinical trial is within the goals and mission of the NCI and is appropriate for this FOA.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"With joint funding from the Laney Graduate School and the Dean's Office of Emory College of Arts and SciencesFellows will commit about 15 hours per week in the Undergraduate Research Partner Program, an Emory College program promoting undergraduate research for students in all disciplines - including those who are new researchers (see http://college.emory.edu/undergraduate-research/opportunities/research-\n\npartners-program.html).\n\nThe fellowship period is 9 months, September 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025.  The fellow will receive a 9-month stipend (September - May) along with a 100% subsidy for the Emory University Student Health Insurance Plan (EUSHIP). The first stipend payment will be at the end of September and the final payment will be at the end of May. The stipend will be $27,282 paid over 9-\n\nmonths. For the fellowship year 2024-25 there is also a supplemental pay of $1,000 extra for hum-SS fellows which will be paid as one lump sum in the Fall. There may be earlier preparation work occurring in August.\n\nFellows will be expected to work jointly during the academic year and summer session to develop and plan research skill-building workshops for students in the SIRE Research Partner Programs. The program participants may include first-, second- or third-year students with a wide range of previous research experience (no experience to several semesters). Workshop topics generally focus on research methods, research ethics, visiting research sites or presentation of research in various settings. Some sessions will be led by graduate fellows; other workshops can be led by others on campus with special expertise. In addition, each fellow works closely with a small group of students in group and individual meetings to follow their progress and provide research support. When necessary, graduate fellows will work with students and their faculty mentors to solve problems that emerge. In addition to helping develop programming for Undergraduate Research programs, fellows also help promote and recruit students to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program. The SURE programs involves undergraduate students in residence on campus working as faculty research assistants and/or on their own research projects. Fellows are expected to complete their PhDs by Spring 2025.\n\nFellows will also work on their own professional development and will create (or revise and update) a teaching philosophy statement, mentoring philosophy statement, and other documents for their portfolios as needed. Fellows will work with program directors to develop and implement activities, workshops, and curricula that may be distributed, modified and published as appropriate.\n\nOur undergraduate research programs strive for a diverse mix of participants and leaders.\n\nGraduate students who identify with underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply.\"",

        "title": "\"NeuroNEXT Clinical Trials (U01 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-21-223  \n**Background:**\n\n\n\nTo facilitate the cooperation and partnering of public and private funding organizations, universities, academic medical centers, research institutes, contract research organizations, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies, NINDS has formed the Neurology Network of Excellence in Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT, www.NeuroNEXT.org). NeuroNEXT has a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and a group of 25 geographically distributed clinical sites in the United States.\n\n\n\nThis FOA provides one of two different means by which teams of investigators can gain access to the NeuroNEXT infrastructure. This FOA uses the U01 cooperative agreement mechanism and is open to all eligible applicants, as defined in Section III. Small businesses may wish to consider applying through [PAR-21-224](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-224.html)) \"NeuroNEXT Small Business Innovation in Clinical Trials (U44)\" or its reissues.\n\n\n\n**Purpose/Research Objectives:**\n\n\n\nThis clinical research network develops and conducts multiple, scientifically sound, possibly biomarker-informed exploratory clinical trials evaluating the most promising therapies, whether from academic, foundation or industry discoveries. Examples include Phase 2 clinical trials and clinical research studies aimed at validating biomarkers and clinical outcomes in preparation for clinical trials. NeuroNEXT provides a robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols in neurological disorders affecting adult and/or pediatric populations. While the network is not specific to one disease, it has the capacity to coordinate a cadre of specialist investigators to implement studies efficiently in response to disease-specific opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe network is designed to increase the efficiency of clinical trials, to facilitate patient recruitment and retention, to increase the quality of neuroscience clinical trials, and to enable public-private partnerships.\n\n\n\nTo foster the development of clinical trialists, the NeuroNEXT investigators who have been selected for their experience and training in neurological clinical research will provide a source of strong mentorship and support to investigators who are early in their careers as approved studies are implemented within the infrastructure.\n\n\n\n**Specific Areas of Research Interest:**\n\n\n\nThis FOA encourages applications for exploratory clinical trials of investigational agents (drugs, biologics, surgical therapies or devices) that may contribute to the justification for and provide the data required for designing a future trial, for biomarker validation studies, or for proof of mechanism clinical studies. Applications for drugs or biologics should provide compelling scientific evidence that the investigational agent proposed for study will reach/act upon the designated target or that its mechanism of action is such that it is expected to be of benefit in ameliorating a specific aspect of the disease. Neurologic diseases chosen for study must fall within the primary responsibility of NINDS ([www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm)).\n\n\n\nExamples of appropriate studies under this FOA include, but are not limited to, those designed to:\n\n\n\n-  Evaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in the target population.\n\n-  Select or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, safety data, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials).\n\n-  Evaluate biological activity relative to clinical endpoints.\n\n-  For medical devices, in addition to providing initial clinical safety data, appropriate studies are those that inform the next phase of development, usually by finalizing the device design, establishing operator technique, and/or finalizing the choice of study endpoints for the design of a pivotal clinical trial.\n\n\n\nA separate clinical trials network has been established and funded by NINDS to conduct clinical trials and biomarker studies for stroke treatment, prevention and recovery; thus NeuroNEXT has been established for the conduct of studies in neurological disorders other than stroke. Multi-site studies in stroke prevention, treatment and/or recovery are not appropriate for this FOA; those studies would be considered by NIH StrokeNet: [http://www.nihstrokenet.org/](http://www.nihstrokenet.org/). Separate clinical trial networks also exist for the conduct of studies in neurological emergencies (SIREN: [https://siren.network/](https://siren.network/)) and pain (EPPIC-NET: [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC)). Studies on these topics should be directed to the dedicated networks. Studies primarily focused on biomarker validation may also apply to one of the NINDS Biomarker funding opportunities [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Tools-Topics/Biomarkers](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Tools-Topics/Biomarkers). \n\n\n\nPhase 1 clinical trials should be directed to the exploratory clinical trial FOA ([PAR-18-420](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-18-420.html) and [PAR-18-617](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-18-617.html)). Phase 1b/2a trials requiring multi-center implementation can be considered under this FOA.\n\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\n\n\nApplicants should make note of the following:\n\n\n\n(1) Applicants to this FOA will be required to incorporate the NeuroNEXT infrastructure ([www.neuronext.org](http://www.neuronext.org/)) into their proposed study. Additional (ad-hoc) sites may be proposed to fulfill specific study requirements, if a compelling justification exists. All applicants will be required to use the master clinical trial agreements and central IRB that have been established for NeuroNEXT.\n\n\n\n(2) Efficacy: This FOA is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to confirm efficacy of a drug or biologic.\n\n\n\n(3) Secondary Aims:\n\n\n\n*For drugs and biologics*, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in an exploratory clinical trial. Examples of such secondary aims include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  Determining the optimal measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention\n\n-  Collecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers\n\n\n\n*For medical device,* Early Feasibility or Traditional Feasibility studies, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. These may include:\n\n\n\n-  Identifying appropriate modifications to the procedure or device to enable a subsequent Pivotal study on a finalized system;\n\n-  Refining the intended use population;\n\n-  Developing and refining data collection procedures;\n\n-  Refining the non-clinical test plans or methodologies; and\n\n-  Developing subsequent clinical study protocols.\n\n\n\n(4) The NIH recognizes that devices can vary greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. Consequently, the appropriate pathway to market may require a traditional Feasibility and Pivotal study in support of an eventual Pre-Market Approval submission, or may require a more limited study to address specific issues in support of an FDA 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Clinical studies involving devices may utilize the entire NeuroNEXT Network, or a more limited subset of centers selected based on appropriate expertise for the given device. Investigators are encouraged to contact NINDS Program Staff as early as possible to discuss how the NeuroNEXT network may best be utilized in support of their specific device project. NINDS anticipates that the majority of device projects utilizing NeuroNEXT will be traditional Feasibility Studies in order to best leverage the advantages of the network. An Early Feasibility Study should be designed in accordance with FDA's draft guidance, \"Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies\", see [https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigational-device-exemptions-ides-early-feasibility-medical-device-clinical-studies-including](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigational-device-exemptions-ides-early-feasibility-medical-device-clinical-studies-including) to allow for early clinical evaluation of devices to provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data while device design and operations are still in development. A Traditional Feasibility Study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan a Pivotal Study.\n\n\n\nEarly Feasibility and Traditional Feasibility study designs may include single-arm case series, on-off interventions (patients as own controls), device-device comparisons, comparisons to historic controls, comparisons to performance controls, or adaptive/Bayesian designs.\n\n\n\n(5) Rare Diseases: Applications in rare diseases are encouraged while recognizing that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements normally required to establish the efficacy of an intervention. NINDS acknowledges that innovative, non-traditional trial designs including adaptive designs may be appropriate in rare disease studies. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating sites and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting. While NeuroNEXT is primarily intended for exploratory trials, the network will consider Phase 2/3 trials in diseases with a US prevalence of under 5,000 persons.\n\n\n\n(6) Rationale: Exploratory trials primarily test hypotheses in relatively small programs so that the acceptable risk and uncertainty are higher than in later stage programs. Exploratory clinical trials must anchor their rationale in (1) an unmet medical need; (2) a plausible biological mechanism; (3) non-clinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data; and/or (4) early clinical data. Their individual weight should be carefully assessed in the specific context of the application at hand. There is no requirement to provide support from all four areas. However, supporting data should be robust enough to justify the proposed phase of study. Applicants should consider the limitations of those studies with regards to the scientific rigor guidelines published by NINDS (see [https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-023.html](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-023.html)). Preclinical data (such as from animal studies) that do not sufficiently meet the rigor guidelines or are not sufficiently associated with the human condition may be inadequate to support the rationale for the study.\n\n\n\n(7) Pharmacometrics: Applications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the ultimate aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.\n\n\n\n(8) The award and continuation of funding are subject to milestones to be specified in the notice of grant award according to NINDS policies.\n\n\n\n(9) NIH Resources: As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:\n\n\n\n(a) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program ([https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa](https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa));\n\n\n\n(b) NeuroQOL ([http://www.neuroqol.org](http://www.neuroqol.org/));\n\n\n\n(c) NIH Toolbox ([http://www.nihtoolbox.org](http://www.nihtoolbox.org/));\n\n\n\n(d) PROMIS ([http://www.nihpromis.org](http://www.nihpromis.org/)); and\n\n\n\n(e) NINDS Common Data Elements ([http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov](http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/)).\n\n\n\n(10) Mobile Technologies: Applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) mobile technologies to facilitate data collection and protocol adherence on the part of research participants and study site staff.\n\n\n\n(11) For Biomarker Validation Studies, biomarkers are defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions. Categories of biomarkers include: Susceptibility/risk, diagnostic, monitoring, prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic/response, and safety. Biomarker studies should define their intended Context of Use (a statement that fully and clearly describes the way the biomarker will be used in future clinical trials).\n\n\n\nWorking with NeuroNEXT is a cooperative venture between NINDS, the NeuroNEXT network and the applicant. NINDS will provide guidance to potential applicants with input from NINDS Program Staff and the NeuroNEXT Executive Committee. Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NINDS Scientific/Research Contacts (see Agency Contacts, Section VII) in order to discuss the feasibility of conducting the proposed trial through the NeuroNEXT infrastructure before submitting an application. Pre-application consultation may include an introductory teleconference (at least 3 months prior to submission), followed by a conference call or in-person meeting with NINDS staff, as needed.\n\n\n\nFunding decisions will also be based on a study's fit for the network relative to other proposed and ongoing trials.\n\n\n\nClinical trial applications that do not include the appropriate documentation listed in section 4.5 of the Human Subjects andClinical Trials Information Form will be withdrawn and not reviewed. Prior to grant award, awardees who do not have an exemption from the FDA must provide any additional FDA correspondence regarding the status of the protocol to the NINDS, especially if the trial has been placed under full or partial hold.\n\n\n\nSee [Section VIII.

        "title": "\"FY22 Carbon Utilization Technology: Improving Efficient Systems for Algae - Topic Area 1: Carbon Utilization Efficiency from Biomass- or Atmospheric-Based Sources of Carbon Dioxide\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: DE-FOA-0002654\n**A.  Background and Context**\n\n**i. Background and Purpose**\n\n\n\nBuilding a clean and equitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will advance the Biden Administration's goals to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and to \"deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050\"1 to the benefit of all Americans. The Department of Energy (DOE) is committed to pushing the frontiers of science and engineering, catalyzing clean energy jobs through research, development, demonstration, and deployment, and ensuring environmental justice and inclusion of underserved communities.  This FOA is funded by two DOE offices: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's (EERE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management's (FECM) Carbon Utilization Program (CUP) . The research and development (R&D) activities funded by this FOA will support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving the innovation that can lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection.\n\n\n\nUtilization of waste carbon dioxide is of critical importance to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.2 Algae is a promising source of renewable carbon that can grow on waste carbon dioxide (CO2), including CO2 captured from concentrated point sources or the ambient air. Fuels and products made from algae can be infrastructure-\n\ncompatible, high-performance blendstocks, direct replacements, and/or additives to existing products. The cultivation of algae also delivers benefits of the bioeconomy to new areas of the nation outside traditional agricultural and forestry areas. Using the carbon dioxide recycled in algae biomass to make affordable biofuels and bioproducts can displace greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from conventional products.\n\n\n\nThe primary focus of BETO is on developing technologies that convert domestic biomass and/or waste resources, such as algae, into affordable biofuels and bioproducts that significantly reduce carbon emissions on a life  cycle basis as compared to equivalent petroleum-based products. These bioenergy technologies can enable a transition to a clean energy economy, create high-quality jobs, support rural economies, and spur innovation in renewable energy and chemicals production. The activities funded by BETO through this opportunity will mobilize public clean energy investment in biofuels, bio-based chemicals, and agricultural industries, accelerate the deployment of bioenergy technologies, and support achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions by 2050 by advancing the development of algal biofuels. Development of technologies for growing algae (including microalgae, macroalgae, and cyanobacteria) and conversion to biofuels and bioproducts is an important component of BETO's strategy for enabling the production of at least 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2030 with room for further volumetric growth through 2040 and 2050.\n\n\n\nThe priority of CUP is to develop multiple pathways by which captured CO2 is converted or recycled into economically viable and environmentally sustainable products. The near-term objective of this program's R&D is to ameliorate the cost of carbon capture and accelerate deployment of carbon management technologies through the conversion of CO2 into value-added products. The program spans multiple technology approaches that include thermal, electrochemical, and bio-mediated pathways to utilize CO2. The activities funded by CUP through this FOA will demonstrate the economical and environmentally sustainable manufacturing of products through the biological uptake of CO2 via algal systems.\n\n\n\nFollowing a joint stakeholder workshop in 2017, BETO and CUP have run separate FOAs on carbon utilization efficiency in algae systems.5 The current collaborative FOA expands on expertise within the two offices' existing FOA portfolios. Given the complementary mission areas of the offices, issuing this joint FOA reflects the Department's commitment to algae R&D, as well as its desire to cooperate effectively across mission areas and streamline processes for its applicants.\n\n\n\nB. Topic Areas\n\n\n\nThis FOA has two topic areas funded separately by BETO and CUP in response to specific language in each office's respective Congressional appropriations and in accordance with each office's strategic program plans. Both BETO and CUP maintain algae research programs with complementary focus areas: BETO with a focus on lowering the cost of biofuels and CUP with a focus on utilization of utility and industrial point sources of carbon dioxide emissions into bioproducts.\n\n\n\nTopic Area 1, funded by BETO, is to support the development of algal biofuels through the utilization of carbon dioxide generated via fermentation (e.g., ethanol production), biogas purification (e.g., CO2 removed from anaerobic digestion or landfill gas collection), or sourced from the ambient air either via Direct Air Capture (DAC) systems and delivered to algae media or via accelerated diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere into algae systems.\n\n\n\n**i. Topic Area 1: Carbon Utilization Efficiency from Biomass- or Atmospheric-Based Sources of Carbon Dioxide**\n\n\n\nTopic Area 1 aligns with the goals of BETO's Advanced Algal Systems (AAS) R&D program (see the BETO Multi-Year Program Plan for a full description14). The overall strategic goal of the AAS program is to develop technologies that enable production of environmentally sustainable algal feedstocks that perform reliably in conversion processes to yield renewable fuel blendstocks, as well as bioproducts and chemical intermediates. Processes like ethanol fermentation and biogas cleanup result in high purity CO2 streams.  Direct Air Capture allows for the delivery of concentrated CO2\n\nwithout coupling to CO2 distribution infrastructure. Algae growth systems use CO2 to produce algal biomass via photosynthesis. This biomass is a source of renewable carbon that can be used to displace petroleum-based products such as liquid transportation fuels or plastics, thus closing the carbon loop while preserving critical functions of the economy such as air travel.\n\n\n\nTopic Area 1 specifically seeks to increase the carbon utilization efficiency of algal growth systems that use carbon dioxide sourced from fermentation (e.g., ethanol production), biogas purification (e.g., CO2 removed from anaerobic digestion or landfill gas collection), or directly from the atmosphere. Using these CO2 sources, algae grown on non-arable land and without freshwater are critical to expanding the domestic resource potential for biomass. Algae are a high-quality feedstock for conversion to SAF and could greatly expand the domestic supply potential of SAF feedstocks. In algae systems, the cost of CO2 is a major operational cost and addressing the utilization efficiency will both lower the overall costs and improve the GHG reduction potential of the fuels. The impact of the Topic Area 1 outcome will be to lower the cost of fuels and products made from algal feedstocks while increasing the positive GHG impacts that can be achieved through deployment of algae-based technologies.\n\n\n\nThe objective of Topic Area 1 is to develop technologies that increase CUE in algal systems by minimizing the loss of captured carbon dioxide supplied to the system.\n\nStrategies could include altering the water chemistry of algae growth media to increase CO2 retention, isolating novel strains or improving existing algae strains to tolerate the altered media, developing novel CO2 delivery systems, and modifying algae growth operational strategies to maximize carbon retention. Strategies must be specific to the CO2 source and propose solutions that reflect the unique characteristics and contaminants of the specific CO2 source. Selected projects will verify the effectiveness of their technologies in at least two separate field research campaigns (outdoors in an industrially relevant setting) of at least 30 days each without negatively affecting algae biomass productivity, composition, or nitrogen utilization efficiency. Projects are encouraged to propose transformational approaches that both define and attempt to meet the theoretical limits of CUE in their proposed algal system.\n\n\n\nWhile pathways to SAF from many types of biomass exist, photosynthetic algae-based lipids are a highly relevant feedstock for SAF because of their potential to expand domestic supply of plant-based oils for fuels and products and because there are already commercial, ASTM International approved conversion pathways to upgrade algal lipids to SAF. The ability of certain microalgae cells to accumulate exceptional amounts of lipids is well documented; however biological and engineering challenges remain in achieving viable operational strategies to realize such potential and deliver cost-effective algae-based lipids. Therefore, Topic Area 1 also encourages integration of carbon utilization R&D with work to lower the cost and increase the positive GHG impact of photosynthetically generated algae lipids suitable for conversion to SAF.\"",

        "description": "\"Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College\nThis Cardiovascular Disease fellowship program takes place at Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. It is a three- to four-year program that prepares highly qualified candidates for careers in investigative and clinical cardiology.\n\n\n\nOur program is one of approximately 170 programs accredited by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and participates in the Match conducted by the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP). The Internal Medicine Subspecialty Match for each academic year is now held in December of the year prior to the start of the fellowship in July.\n\n\n\n**Overview**\n\n\n\nThis Fellowship is based at the Weill Cornell Campus of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and includes clinical and research resources at our neighboring sister institution, Hospital for Special Surgery.\n\n\n\nClinical and research opportunities at both institutions are an integral part of the program, which is designed to train physicians interested in developing academic and clinical careers in cardiology. The 4.5 acres surrounding the hospital holds one of the largest concentrations of biomedical research and care anywhere in the world, including the Rockefeller Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, both of which provide additional research opportunities.\n\n\n\n**Well-rounded training**: The program integrates a broad-based, in-depth clinical and research experience to deliver the highest-quality academic training to cardiology professionals. Clinical care is the focus of the first two years, while the third and fourth years involve a more intensive, mentored experience in a clinical subspecialty or basic research. Every fellow is expected to be productive in research. An added year (or more) of training/research in a subspecialty area can be arranged.\n\n\n\n**Clinical experience**: The clinical training here is unsurpassed. It includes rotations in:\n\n\n\n-    The cardiac intensive care unit and cardiac step-down units\n\n-    The inpatient consultation service at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the Hospital for Special Surgery\n\n-    The cardiac catheterization lab\n\n-    The electrophysiology lab\n\n-    Cardiac graphics\n\n-    Heart failure\n\n-    Echocardiography\n\n-    Nuclear cardiology\n\nFellows spend one half-day per week in the outpatient clinic in adult cardiology. Fellows are trained and supervised clinically with one-on-one teaching by senior faculty. The didactic sessions include:\n\n\n\n-    A full introductory curriculum\n\n-    Weekly curriculum throughout the year\n\n-    Prevention and Management Conference\n\n-    Imaging Conference (specific to echo, cardiac CT and MRI), Clinical Case Conferences\n\n-    Monthly Journal Club\n\n-    Cardiovascular Grand Rounds\n\n-    Subspecialty conferences in catheterization, electrophysiology, adult congenital heart disease, vascular disease, and heart failure\n\nAt Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian, the Department of Medicine has approximately 17,000 admissions per year of which more than 3,000 are admitted to the cardiology inpatient service. Approximately 2,500 cardiology patients are seen in an ambulatory setting each year. A broad range of cardiological problems is assessed, including complex congenital heart disease, advanced heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\n\nThe invasive cardiac laboratories perform all diagnostic catheterizations, percutaneous interventions (including ASD and PFO closures), and electrophysiological studies (including ablations of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and device implantation). We also actively enroll patients in large clinical trials, including those evaluating new stents, percutaneous aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair, implantation of closure devices for paravalvular regurgitation, and renal artery denervation for resistant hypertension.\n\n\n\n**Research**: Fellowship research projects tie in with ongoing research activities within the program. Each fellow's research experience is coordinated by a faculty mentor of his/her choosing.\n\n\n\nFor fellows pursuing basic science or translational research, a master s degree in science is offered over a two-year period. (These courses are scheduled within years two, three, or four.) Fellows pursuing a project in clinical research are encouraged to pursue a certificate in clinical investigation. All fellows are expected to present the results of their research at regional and national meetings.\n\n\n\nThe Weill Cornell Cardiology Fellowship Program is dedicated to advancing knowledge in both basic and clinical research. Multiple federal and non-federal grants strongly support the research program. Research is performed on-site in our state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.\n\n\n\nResearch is conducted in both traditional and emerging areas of cardiovascular research, including:\n\n\n\n-    Atherosclerosis\n\n-    Vascular physiology\n\n-    Electrophysiology and arrhythmia\n\n-    Stem cells and cell therapy\n\n-    Cardiac development\n\n-    Stroke and thrombosis\n\n-    Heart failure\n\n-    Interventional devices\n\n-    Health policy\n\nSeventy percent of Weill Cornell cardiology faculty members take part in world-class basic science, translational, or clinical research, and 30 percent are full-time clinical cardiologists involved in clinical investigations and teaching.\n\n\n\nAfter three years of training, candidates are eligible for board certification in cardiovascular disease, but would require at least one more year of training to subspecialize in Interventional Cardiology, Electrophysiology, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology, or advanced imaging.\n\n\n\nOur fellows receive comprehensive experience in all major clinical and laboratory aspects of contemporary cardiology under the close supervision of full-time staff. Also, all fellows are expected to take part in one or more areas of ongoing research during their training.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: NSF 22-622\n**Synopsis**\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) unveiled a set of \"Big Ideas,\" 10 bold, long-term research and process ideas that identify areas for future investment at the frontiers of science and engineering (see [https://www.nsf.gov/news/special\\_reports/big\\_ideas/index.jsp](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/index.jsp)). The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research. As such, when responding to this solicitation, even though proposals must be submitted to the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) / Division of Human Resource Development (HRD), once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors.\n\n\n\nThe INCLUDES Initiative is a comprehensive, national effort to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discovery and innovation, focused on NSF's commitment to ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in STEM fields, as communicated in the [NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22068/nsf22068.pdf). The vision of the INCLUDES Initiative is to catalyze the STEM enterprise to work collaboratively for inclusive change, resulting in a STEM workforce that reflects the diversity of the Nation s population. More specifically, the INCLUDES Initiative seeks to motivate and accelerate collaborative infrastructure building to advance equity and sustain systemic change to broaden participation in STEM fields at scale. Significant advancement in the inclusion of groups that have historically been excluded from or underserved in STEM will result in a new generation of STEM talent and leadership to secure the Nation s future and long-term economic competitiveness.  \n\n\n\nWith this solicitation, NSF offers support for five types of projects that connect and contribute to the National Network: (1) Design and Development Launch Pilots, (2) Collaborative Change Consortia, (3) Alliances, (4) Network Connectors, and (5) Conferences. The INCLUDES National Network is a multifaceted collaboration of agencies, organizations, and individuals working collectively to broaden participation in STEM. The INCLUDES National Network serves as a testbed for designing, implementing, studying, refining, and scaling collaborative change models and is composed of: \n\n\n\n-   INCLUDES funded projects  \n\n    \n\n-   Other NSF funded projects\n\n\n\n-   Subcommittee on Federal Coordination in STEM Education (FC-STEM) agencies  \n\n    \n\n-   Scholars engaged in broadening participation research and evaluation, and  \n\n    \n\n-   Organizations that support the development of talent from all sectors of society to build an inclusive STEM workforce.\n\n\n\nAll INCLUDES funded projects must operationalize five design elements of collaborative infrastructure \\- (1) shared vision, (2) partnerships, (3) goals and metrics, (4) leadership and communication, and (5) expansion, sustainability, and scale \\- to create systemic change that will lead to the substantially broadened participation of individuals from historically excluded and underserved groups in STEM.\n\n\n\nWith this solicitation, NSF invites proposals for five types of projects (described below)that connect and contribute to the National Network: (1) Design and Development Launch Pilots, (2) Collaborative Change Consortia, (3) Alliances, (4) Network Connectors, and (5) Conferences. Investigators planning to submit a proposal are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page description of their proposal idea to [nsfincludes@nsf.gov](mailto:nsfincludes@nsf.gov) at least three months prior to proposal submission. An INCLUDES program director with related expertise will review and provide feedback on the alignment of the idea with the solicitation.\n\n\n\nProposals that address broadening participation challenges not yet represented in the INCLUDES portfolio of projects are encouraged. Proposals that focus on broadening participation in STEM innovation and entrepreneurship are especially encouraged. For more information on funded INCLUDES projects, see: [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=nsf+includes](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=nsf+includes).\n\n\n\n**4\\. Network Connectors** initiate or maintain linkages to the INCLUDES National Network for projects or partnerships that are not currently funded by the INCLUDES Initiative. Network connector proposals may be submitted by existing NSF-funded and non-NSF funded projects seeking funding to provide or participate in: \n\n\n\n-   new collaborations that expand the impact of active or previously-funded INCLUDES projects;\n\n    \n\n-   new opportunities for collaboration across the INCLUDES National Network;\n\n\n\n-   novel ideas to bring a community of NSF-funded projects into the INCLUDES National Network; \n\n    \n\n-   efforts to equitably scale up innovative and evidence-based approaches to broadening participation in STEM; \n\n    \n\n-   NSF-funded research activities with the goal of broadening participation in STEM; \n\n    \n\n-   development of shared goals, measures, and mutually reinforcing activities to build collaborative infrastructure for broadening participation in STEM; \n\n    \n\n-   communicating knowledge and results from the NSF broadening participation portfolio of programs and projects, NSF Center-scale activities, or other major Foundation investments; or\n\n\n\n-   communicating findings from the science of broadening participation research community to the INCLUDES National Network, especially pertaining to new efforts to translate basic research into practice.\n\n\n\nNetwork Connectors implement connections to NSF-funded or other existing projects and evidence-based approaches. A letter of collaboration from a leader of the existing project is needed. Institutions and organizations that are new to the National Network who are looking to adopt or adapt evidence-based practices that emerged from current or previously-funded INCLUDES projects are encouraged to apply.\n\n\n\n**Network connector proposals may request up to $250,000 per year for up to two years.** Requests that exceed $250,000 may be considered, depending on the description of need in the proposal and the proposed activities.\"",

They both were originally from Michigan. Each completed undergraduate studies at Michigan State University, Pete with a degree in liberal arts and Sally with a degree in math. Pete went on to earn an MBA from Harvard University.  \n\n  \n\nThe majority of the couple's working lives were spent in Tennessee in the area of Rhea County, where they operated the Watts Bar Resort for many years. The resort was located on property leased from the TVA. There were cabins on the property which had been renovated by the Smiths, and the resort operated from spring through fall. The Smiths also traveled extensively, and there was a game room at the resort featuring Pete s safari trophies. The resort offered horseback riding, boating on the lake, fishing, and swimming, as well as an on-site restaurant. Landscaping was maintained at a high level, and bird feeders were provided. The Smiths were also car aficionados.  \n\n  \n\nThe Smiths spent their later years in Seneca, SC (Oconee County) where they were closer to some of Sally s family, one of whom suffered from Alzheimer s. Pete Smith died in 1979 of kidney disease, and Sally Smith died in 1992.\"",

Research Experiences for Teachers Sites (RET Sites; RETS) will be based at institutions of higher learning or other non-profit organizations in the U.S. that conduct educational and research activities. RETS with a focus on Biological Sciences (BIORETS) will include research projects in fields that are supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences. BIORETS may be based in a single discipline or department or may offer interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme. An important goal of the program is to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in biological research and those from geographically underrepresented areas in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Proposals are strongly encouraged to involve members of these groups both as participants and as mentors. BIORETS awards are expected to leverage the teachers' research experiences for curriculum development, with the goal of enriching their classroom teaching practices and inspiring a broad swath of students to consider higher education and careers in STEM. \n\n\n\nTeachers supported with NSF funds in BIORETS projects must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or permanent residents of the United States.\"",

        "description": " Low-Cost Point-of-Need Approaches and Technologies to Lower the Barriers to Substance Use Disorders (SUD) Diagnosis and Treatment (R43/R44 Clinical Trial Optional)\"In 2020, 40.3 million people aged 12 or older had substance use disorder (SUD) in the past year. Of those, 2.6 million people (6.4%) received any in-person treatment, while 2.2 million (5.4%) received virtual services for substance use treatment. Therefore, an estimated 35 million people did not receive any treatment.\n\n\n\nTo receive treatment, individuals need to receive a diagnosis from a provider, get a referral to a respective treatment program, and start treatment. This is a challenging endeavor, even when the individual is determined to get help, as many patients often encounter significant barriers to receiving a diagnosis and treatment for SUD. 31% of Medicaid patients cite the barriers to access as a reason not to start treatment. These barriers include for example availability and access to diagnosis and treatment, length and frequency of visits, cost, and stigma. Additionally, in low-resource settings - rural communities, poor neighborhoods, tribal areas, jails - there are location-specific problems. Examples include lack of access to fast internet, lower incomes and other social determinants, which can add to the barriers.\n\n\n\nA significant hurdle is finding a provider nearby who can diagnose the disorder, has registration with the Drug Enforcement Administration as required by the type of medication, and is willing to prescribe medication. This is especially acute in states with low population density and in rural areas, as most of the licensed providers and 92% of substance abuse treatment centers are located in urban areas. As a result, the average travel distance to a place where one can get help and accepts Medicaid is 35 miles; the average distance to centers that do not accept Medicaid is 30 miles, while the average distance to a primary healthcare provider is 8 miles, and the average distance to the nearest hospital is 5 miles in urban areas and 10 miles in rural areas. The consequences are long travel times, lost work hours, and a high cost of transportation, which may act as a deterrent to SUD treatment.\n\n\n\nAnother barrier is the need for frequent visits to a treatment center. In the case of methadone or in-center buprenorphine treatment, visits help the patients undergo careful initiation and titration (gradual increase) to achieve dose stabilization. The selection of proper timing and the correct dose at the beginning of the treatment is critical to avoid negative experiences, e.g., precipitated withdrawal, as they often result in treatment discontinuation. Discontinuation is associated with a 10-fold increase in the risk for relapse, increasing the risk of overdose and death. When the initiation is done at home, as is often the case with buprenorphine, it is imperative to time the initiation to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Regular follow-up is highly recommended, as it has been shown to help with retention. Typically, visits to the treatment center provide an appropriate setting for these interventions. Over the past few years, there have been many attempts to utilize telemedicine approaches instead of in-center visits (related to the social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic). However, at times, the proposed solutions do not consider the realities of the environment in low-resource settings. For example, recent research suggests that between 20 and 50% of the rural population lacks broadband (fast internet service). The same is true for Black and Hispanic communities, where the rate is 30%. Even when it is available, in many areas there is only one service provider, which may result in high prices for internet access, and lower speeds. Then, there is a lack of sufficient digital literacy in these areas, even when the resource is available. In addition, in jails telemedicine services must conform to security rules.\n\n\n\nAfter initiation, more visits to the treatment center are typically required for dispensing; in the case of methadone, for verification that the dose is taken, as well as for titration based on the individual's response. During these visits, samples are obtained to monitor drug metabolism, as well as for possible relapses, which may be used to further adjust the treatment dose. It is known that the half-life of methadone in individual patients can vary significantly, with documented values between 8 and 59 hours. As there are no devices for rapid and low-cost quantitative measurement of drug concentrations and their metabolites, titration is achieved by gradual increases in the dose over several days and careful monitoring of the symptoms. Available devices (test strips) are only qualitative; the sampling is done during the treatment visits, and subsequent quantitative analysis is done at an external lab only when misuse is suspected. Their use at home is prone to tampering and inaccuracies due to variations in storage conditions, sample volume, or the possibility of switching the samples. The lack of devices for rapid quantification delays the achievement of a stable dose (which would allow for the patients to take home a week's supply) and adds the number of the visits to adjust therapy, thus increasing the burden for the patients. The lack of devices suitable for home use also prevents the ability to do extended monitoring.\n\n\n\nIn treatment, there is a recent trend to inject medications, e.g., extended-release naltrexone or extended-release buprenorphine. The approach allows for less frequent administration of the medications (once every three days or once a week), and the medication dose was lower than the oral route. This route for administration is often preferred in jails, where it significantly decreases the possibilities for diversion. However, withdrawing the exact amount of medication from a vial and injecting it is often challenging. Prefilled syringes may not always allow for accurate dosing of the medication when less than the full volume is injected. The need for varying the amount of the injected medication often arises during initiation. The increased cost comes from discarding unused medication. Utilizing syringes prefilled with different volumes can also lead to increased cost. In addition, receiving an incorrect dose can result in negative experiences (insufficient suppression of withdrawal symptoms or precipitated withdrawal). Existing autoinjectors for medications, while accurate, are costly and may not be always reimbursed, which creates a financial barrier to their use. The high cost of over-the-counter autoinjectors has been reported as a reason not to use them.\n\n\n\nFinally, substantial psychological barriers prevent people from entering and staying in treatment. For example, the concerns about being viewed negatively by one's community or a possible adverse impact on current and future employment prospects can stop a patient from using devices that can be used for treatment. A second issue may be the perception that the technology is used for tracking due to a lack of trust.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to encourage the development of field-deployable, low-cost point-of-need approaches and technologies that can potentially lower the barriers to diagnosis and treatment at any stage of the patient journey through SUD. The availability of such approaches and technologies will allow treatment to be brought to the patient, versus the need for the patient to travel to receive treatment.\n\n\n\nProjects proposed under this NOFO may include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  Low-cost approaches to diagnosis and treatment suitable for low-resource settings that offer to monitor and/or support while minimizing the need for travel during treatment. Examples include asynchronous or real-time telehealth services (e.g., electronic message boards, forums) that are accessible without high-speed internet (e.g., via messaging, MMS, voice, email)\n\n-  Low-cost devices for mobile quantification of drugs and their metabolites during SUD treatment that are suitable for use at home. Examples include novel devices or kits developed specifically for low-resource settings, and repurposed existing low-cost devices that work with blood, interstitial fluid to measure new targets. Devices should be inconspicuous and allow for user control\n\n-  Low-cost, universal autoinjector that can be used to deliver accurate dosing of various therapeutics. The autoinjector can be mechanically or electronically actuated\n\n-  Low-cost point-of-care (POC) approaches for dispensing liquid drugs with built-in security features and support for the therapeutic regimen\n\n-  Low-cost POC approaches or technologies specifically tailored to increase access to treatment in correctional facilities, poor and rural communities, as well as in tribal areas by accounting for logistical, economic, and security constraints.\n\n\n\n**Words Matter**\n\n\n\nDrug addiction is a chronic but treatable disorder with well-understood genetic and social contributors. NIDA encourages preferred language that accurately describes addiction and substance use in all submitted materials without perpetuating stigma and bias. Research shows that using person-first language-such as \"person with a substance use disorder\"-instead of \"substance abuser\" or \"addict\" can reduce negative associations and punitive attitudes among clinicians and researchers. Instead, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) encourages the use of \"addiction\" or \"substance use disorders\" or other specific terminology, such as \"opioid use disorders\" or \"cocaine use disorders\". In addition to using person-first language, NIDA recommends avoiding the term \"substance abuse\" and its derivatives in favor of \"use,\" \"misuse,\" or \"use disorder(s)\" where appropriate. Similarly, \"abuse potential\" may be replaced with \"addiction liability.\"\n\n\n\nNIDA encourages using the term \"medications for opioid use disorder\" (MOUD) instead of \"medication-assisted treatment\" (MAT) or \"opioid substitution therapy\" (OST) when referring to medications prescribed for the treatment of OUD. The term MOUD appropriately frames these life-saving medications as effective, frontline treatments. In contrast, the term MAT implies that medication should have a supplemental or temporary role in treatment. OST reinforces the misconception that MOUD \"substitutes\" one drug for another instead of supporting recovery. The terminology shift to MOUD aligns with the way other psychiatric medications are understood (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) as critical tools central to a patient's treatment plan.\n\n\n\nThese small but powerful substitutions may help address stigma in patients and study participants, which research shows reduces willingness to seek and accept treatment, among other adverse health outcomes.

In contrast, the SBIR Phase II objective is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization.\n\n\n\nBeyond the scope of this NOFO, it is anticipated and encouraged that the outcomes of successful SBIR projects will help attract strategic partners or investors to support the ultimate commercialization of the technology as a publicly available product or service.\n\n\n\nThis NOFO invites four types of applications:\n\n\n\n**Phase I.** The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and determine the quality of performance of the small business recipient organization before proceeding to Phase II.\n\n\n\n**Phase II.** The objective of Phase II is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Therefore, will evaluate whether that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I before deciding on Phase II support.\n\n\n\n**Fast Track.** In an NIH SBIR fast-track both Phase I and Phase II are submitted and reviewed as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should include a clear rationale of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed approach and technology in the SUD area; demonstrate a high probability of commercialization; include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timebound milestone deliverables. It is important to clearly state the go / no-go milestone(s) that will determine transition to Phase II and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-SBIR) from future commercialization partners. The objective of Phase II (as a part of Fast Track applications) is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I to advance technologies to potential commercialization. Projects proposed for Phase II are based on the results achieved in Phase I (or equivalent) and aim to demonstrate scientific and technical merit and commercial potential. Therefore, will evaluate whether that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I and whether proposed milestones have been met before deciding on Phase II support.\n\n\n\n**Direct to Phase II.** NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award for a small business that has already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but has not received a Phase I award for that project. The NIH SBIR Direct to Phase II is appropriate for Phase II submissions regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Small businesses eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects supported with a Phase I SBIR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.\n\n\n\n**First-time applicants may submit a Phase I, Fast-Track, or Direct-to-Phase II application.**\n\n\n\n**Special Considerations**\n\n\n\nNIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the [Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&reserved=0).

Primary among these goals is the development of excellent faculty and undergraduate students in natural sciences. Faculty and students are encouraged to work together in the pursuit of the knowledge and understanding of the basic principles underlying the function of natural systems. It is anticipated that such research will be strongly educational in itself, but that it will also catalyze improvements in traditional science courses through inquiry-based teaching. The primary criterion that will be used in evaluating proposals will be the perceived scientific quality of the research as measured by its likelihood to contribute significantly to fundamental knowledge in the field. A clear commitment of the college or university to support the research will also strengthen a proposal, as will substantial participation of undergraduate students as research associates, rather than merely as technical assistants.\"",

        "description": "\"ExpectedOutcome:  \nProject results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:  \n\n\n\n\\- Contribute to the implementation of EU policy and international commitments (European Green Deal[1], Global Approach to Research and Innovation[2]).  \n\n\\- Identify a core group of Ukrainian cities that would commit to a climate neutrality target, including in reconstruction efforts;  \n\n\\- Accelerate the systemic transition to climate-neutrality of Ukrainian cities by preparing local authorities to meet the overarching objectives of the European Green Deal;  \n\n\\- Increase the visibility of the EU and its cities as leaders and engage cities participating in the Cities Mission in twinning and teaming activities with collaboration-minded Ukrainian city partners. Scope:  \n\nPresident von der Leyen's statement on 27 April 2022[3] and the subsequent Commission Communication on Ukraine Relief and Reconstruction[4] of 18 May 2022 propose to involve, through partnerships, the cities of the European Union in the reconstruction of the Ukrainian cities. This effort provides a unique opportunity for Ukraine and its cities to combine reconstruction considerations with long-term climate neutrality and sustainability objectives in line with the EU Green Deal, relevant international policy frameworks and the New European Bauhaus initiative. This will require systemic approaches and the deployment of innovative solutions to reduce in particular Green House Gas emissions in all sectors of activities so as to comply with the objective of climate neutrality. The purpose of this action is to associate more closely Ukrainian cities in the process of transition towards climate neutrality that is being promoted by the Horizon Europe Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission . Proposals are expected to address all the following activities:  \n\n\n\n\\- Map, on the basis of existing EU and international initiatives[5], the cities in Ukraine that could commit to the target of climate neutrality. The analysis that will be performed will be based on the methodological approach and guidelines published in the call for Expression of Interest of 25 November 2021[6];  \n\n\\- Following this analysis, identify and support a number of Ukrainian cities in developing their strategy for climate neutrality. Support should be provided to increase the awareness and the capacity of the local authorities on the issues related to climate neutrality. When developing their strategy for climate neutrality, cities should pay special attention to the need to reduce energy dependency from fossil fuels, to integrate climate neutrality considerations in their reconstruction plans and, when applicable, a citizen-driven systemic approach;  \n\n\\- Support the twinning and teaming between these Ukrainian cities and like-minded cities involved in the EU Cities Mission[7];  \n\n\\- Facilitate the exchange of good practices within the target group of Ukrainian cities and between them and the other cities in Ukraine.   \n\nThe proposals will take into account the work already done by global city networks such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, C40 Cities and the EU's International Urban and Regional Cooperation Programme, by international and multilateral organisations such as the UN-Habitat, the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, by international associations such as ICLEI and by global initiatives such as the Urban Transition Mission of Mission Innovation. Linkages should also be ensured with international networks that promote piloting activities such as the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) and with the initiatives for urban climate neutrality under the EU's Neighborhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument.  \n\n\n\nClose collaboration with the Mission Platform presently managed by the NetZeroCities project[8] is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the workplan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined at a second stage during the lifetime of the projects. The collaboration with the Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date.  \n\n\n\nCollaboration with programmes and initiatives managed by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should also be considered when helping cities identify sources of funding for the implementation of their climate-neutral strategy.  \n\n\n\nCooperation with the Global Covenant of Mayors [9] as well as with the European Alliance of Cities and Regions for Ukraine, which is being proposed by the European Committee of the Regions[10] for the reconstruction of Ukraine should also be taken into account in order to facilitate the peer to peer cooperation between cities and regions in the European Union and those in Ukraine.  \n\n\n\n[1]The European Green Deal COM(2019) 640 final  \n\n\n\n[2]Global Approach to Research and Innovation Europe's strategy for international cooperation in a changing world COM(2021) 252 final  \n\n\n\n[3]Additional information available at https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/news/statement-president-von-der-leyen-local-and-regional-cooperation-between-ukraine-and-eu-ukraines-2022-04-27_en  \n\n\n\n[4]Document available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/ukraine-relief-reconstruction_en.pdf  \n\n\n\n[5]Proposals should in particular take into account the work done by the U-LEAD with Europe project, more information available at https://donors.decentralization.gov.ua/en/project/u-lead  \n\n\n\n[6]Additional information available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/mission-climate-neutral-and-smart-cities-info-kit-cities-now-available-2021-oct-29_en  \n\n\n\n[7]Additional information available at https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/822ee360-c9bf-11ec-b6f4-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-256649647  \n\n\n\n[8]Additional information available at https://netzerocities.eu/  \n\n\n\n[9]https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/  \n\n\n\n[10]Additional information at https://cor.europa.eu/en/news/Pages/Ukraine-response.aspx\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: USDA-FAS-MCGOVERN-DOLE-PROGRAM-23\nThe principal objectives of the McGovern-Dole Program are to carry out: 1) preschool and school food for education programs in foreign countries to improve food security, reduce the incidence of hunger, and improve literacy and primary education, particularly with respect to girls; and 2) maternal, infant, and child nutrition programs for pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, and children who are five years of age or younger.\n\nMcGovern-Dole feeds school children and improves literacy (especially for girls) in low-income, food-deficit countries around the world. The program provides for the donation of U.S.\n\nagricultural commodities and funds to procure local and regional agricultural commodities, as well as financial and technical assistance, to support McGovern-Dole objectives. FAS enters into a cooperative agreement with a successful Applicant, referred to as a Recipient, to fund the project described in the Applicant's application, following successful negotiation of the agreement.  The program authorizing legislation, Section 3107 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, requires that McGovern-Dole agreements include provisions to achieve graduation or provide other long-term benefits to targeted populations of the country (7 U.S.C.\n\n1736o-1(j)).\n\nBy providing school meals, teacher training, government capacity-building, and related education and nutrition support, McGovern-Dole helps boost school enrollment, increase attendance, and improve reading outcomes and literacy results. McGovern-Dole also provides support to Maternal and Child Nutrition (MCN). To improve health, nutrition, and dietary practices, McGovern-Dole encourages the inclusion of health- and nutrition-sensitive activities such as the use of micronutrient-fortified products; take-home rations; treatments for deworming and diarrhea; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); school gardens; and curriculum-based nutrition education.\n\nThe donation of U.S. commodities is an integral part of McGovern-Dole and Applicants are strongly encouraged to use the U.S. donated commodities to maximize program reach of targeted beneficiaries in the most cost-effective manner. In addition, Applicants are strongly encouraged to allocate approximately ten percent of the total proposed federal award amount for local and regional procurement (LRP) of commodities. All activities must be consistent with the objectives of the program, as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 10. FAS prioritizes sustainability in efforts to reduce poverty and food insecurity in vulnerable economies on their path to becoming self-sufficient. FAS is focusing on helping communities develop sustainable sources of food supplies while building resilience in their food sourcing practices.\n\nFAS will consider applications from all eligible organizations, including current Recipients and new organizations. FAS will prioritize funding for projects in priority countries. For additional information on the priority countries for this funding opportunity, Applicants should refer to Appendix B - Country Guidance. FAS will consider funding a project in a non-priority country, but an application for a non-priority country must include sufficient justification.\n\nFAS expects that applications will build upon the accomplishments of any existing McGovern-\n\nDole activities in the country. Applicants should lay the foundation for a strong McGovern-Dole project, including complementing school feeding efforts already in place. Applications must focus on transition of McGovern-Dole activities to the host governments and local communities and set the path to sustainability. Applicants must work with host governments that have national action plans and are committed to or are working towards the goals of the World Declaration on Education for All s goals1.\n\nFurthermore, applications must align with the McGovern Dole Program Project-Level Results Framework (see Part D Section 4e: Monitoring and Evaluation). All McGovern-Dole projects are subject to independent third-party evaluations.\n\n\n\n**D. Nepal Programming Priorities**\n\nFAS has provided school feeding assistance to Nepal through the McGovern-Dole program since\n\n2005, with projects totaling a combined $106 million. There is presently one active project in six districts located in the remote, hilly, and food-insecure western provinces of Nepal regions.  The $25 million agreement supports approximately 242,000 school age children in approximately 2,415 schools. The school meal consists of U.S. fortified rice, lentils, and vegetable oil as well as locally procured vegetables, rice, and lentils.\n\n\n\nThe Government of Nepal has increasingly demonstrated its commitment to its National School Feeding Program by increasing its annual budget allocations for school feeding from approximately $70 million to $87 million, which results in an increase of 11 Nepali rupees per student per day to 15 rupees per student, daily.  In 2018, the government passed the Right to Food Act and Compulsory Basic Education Act.  Together, these two policy instruments provide the overarching policy framework for the national school meals program.  Additionally, in 2020\n\nthe Government of Nepal expanded its school feeding coverage to grade eight from its previous grade six expansion.  Despite these investments, the Government of Nepal continues to face capacity related challenges that threaten the complete transfer of the school meals program.\n\nThere is still a lack in geographical coverage for all schools, and insufficient investments that prevent the government to fully assume responsibility for its school meals program. FAS seeks to continue the strong support for school meals in Nepal and continue to complement the Government of Nepal's efforts to reach national coverage and full operation of its National School Feeding Program.\n\n\n\nTo continue the momentum of sustainable graduation, future McGovern-Dole programming should continue to target the central and western regions of Nepal. This McGovern-Dole school feeding project in Nepal should focus on the successes gained through the National School Feeding Program and promote a sustainable model that includes local procurement of fresh horticulture products and other commodities as appropriate to incorporate into school meals.\n\n\n\nApplicants should continue to focus on coordinating closely with the USAID Education office on literacy activities that improve performance of school-aged children, including the early grade reading program. Applicants should also consider investments that improve sustainable water management and sanitation, including health, hygiene, and nutrition activities to ensure greater efficiency and impact in similar priority sectors.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: O-BJA-2022-171288\n**Overview** \n\nOJP is committed to advancing work that promotes civil rights and racial equity, increases access to justice, supports crime victims and individuals impacted by the justice system, strengthens community safety and protects the public from crime and evolving threats, and builds trust between law enforcement and the community.\n\nThe Justice for All Act (JFAA), originally enacted in 2004, was reauthorized and updated in 2016 through passage of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act (JFARA). BJA launched the JFARA training and technical assistance (TTA) programs in 2016 in response to the new areas of authority described in the act. This included support for the development of statewide strategic planning to inform resource allocation under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, and TTA for state and local governments to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The purpose of this solicitation is to select up to three providers to deliver TTA services to state and local governments requesting services under the two areas described above. In Category 1, the selected TTA providers will assist BJA JAG grantees and other state and local jurisdictions in completing the required strategic planning consistent with the goals of the initiative. In Categories 2 and 3, the selected TTA partners will assist the field to build their capacity to ensure the provisions of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, with a focus on courts' responsibilities and right to counsel.\n\n\n\n**Specific Information** \n\nThe JFARA amended the JAG statute in several ways. The first requires that each JAG applicant include with its application a \"comprehensive statewide plan detailing how grants received under this section will be used to improve the administration of the criminal justice system.\" Each plan must be updated every 5 years, with annual progress reports.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the JFARA set forth two areas of technical assistance for states and local governments:\n\n\n\n1. Support to develop and implement the required statewide strategic plans to assist policy makers with allocation of JAG resources.\n\n2. Support to meet the obligations established by the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n\nTo address these focus areas, BJA is seeking providers for the following three categories of activities:\n\n\n\n**3. Protection of Constitutional Rights Under the Sixth Amendment: Defense-focused Training and Technical Assistance**: This category will select a provider to offer \"Enhancement of Defense Systems\" and Right to Counsel  TTA, including identifying and disseminating best practices, structures, or models and assisting state and local governments with evaluating, adopting, and implementing systems consistent with securing the right-to-counsel requirement. Applicants are expected to provide national technical assistance to and build capacity of state and local jurisdictions across the United States; as well as develop a mechanism to evaluate practices; support assessments; disseminate practices, information, structures, and models around the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel; and provide TTA on right-to-counsel issues. The purpose of this category is to improve the understanding and the quality of public defense delivery services, guided by the Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System, as well as share resources, information, and practices that will support upholding this obligation. These resources will not address the right to counsel in juvenile cases, but rather will focus on the adult criminal justice system.\n\n\n\nThe applicants in Categories 2 and 3 should have demonstrated expertise in delivering TTA on a national level and have particular knowledge of the Sixth Amendment s right to effective counsel. BJA is looking for a collaborative partnership that will provide expertise and experience working with a range of criminal justice stakeholders, particularly in the fields of defense, court administration, judiciary, and prosecution. The TTA providers should be capable of providing a wide range of expertise to audiences that have differing and sometimes conflicting interests in ensuring effective assistance of counsel, including at first appearance.\n\nApplicants should define the areas in which they will work and identify their focus based on the law and BJA s existing work in this area. These projects will support the use of data and research to enhance stakeholder capacity and assist with efforts to assess, target, and sustain the most critical and effective criminal justice services that will ensure Sixth Amendment rights. As part of this approach, the provider should be able to deploy research assistance to support action research components in the planning process, including using data to define the issue(s) and assessing need; identifying the research and evidence base of proven approaches; supporting testing of innovative approaches; building capacity to adopt, implement, and sustain effective approaches; and periodically assess implementation and success.\n\n\n\nThe selected TTA providers are responsible for responding to grantee requests for assistance and advancing the state of knowledge about their respective subject(s). Approaches to TTA will range from simple to complex, from short- to long-term, from agency-specific to systemwide, depending on the specific needs of the grantee or requestor. Mechanisms for providing TTA can include, but are not limited to: conference calls, onsite consultation, video conferencing, webinars, publications, peer-to-peer learning sessions, coaching, communities of practice, customized resource packets, facilitated sessions, trainings, and guided planning processes (e.g., strategic planning, development and/or review of policy and procedures, and in-person trainings).\"",

A growing share of community-based organizations (CBOs) are coordinating or participating in community-based networks in order to create and respond to an increasing demand from health sector entities that seek social care services and supports at volumes, scopes, and geographic areas larger than a single CBO can typically meet. This has given rise to the emergence of the CCH, with a community-based Lead Entity (LE) that resides at the CCH's core. The intent is to provide funding directly to LEs with an emphasis on areas of the country without existing infrastructure, to build their network maturity and align their service capabilities to contract with health care sector entities (e.g., accountable care organizations, health plans, managed care organizations, hospitals, health systems, and more). Participants will complete an Organizational Capacity Assessment (optional for those that have already done so) to identify capacity to coordinate and streamline contracting, quality assurance, IT system and data integration, and workforce development, as well as access to a menu of social service options so that individuals can obtain the social care they need through a single point of entry. This competitive NOFO will also identify up to 5 regional Centers for Excellence to help provide technical assistance, mentoring and facilitate partnerships across health payers and LEs.\"",

        "description": "\"**Award Profile**  \nAwards are available to pursue a full-time Master's degree program in Political Economy at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). The program is taught in English.\n\n\n\nNTHU is one of Taiwan's most prestigious comprehensive research universities, and is widely known as an incubator for future leaders, with prominent alumni including Nobel laureates. NTHU is located in Hsinchu, a vibrant high-tech hub known as the \"Silicon Valley of Taiwan\" in northern Taiwan, just 30 minutes by high-speed rail from the capital Taipei.\n\n\n\nThe MA program in the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science (TSE) at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) is a master's degree program fully taught in English. TSE prepares talented students for leadership positions in international organizations, government, business and civil society institutions. The MA program also helps students to be better prepared for Ph.D. training and an academic career later on.\n\n\n\nThe mission of TSE is to equip students with extensive knowledge of the dynamics of political economy in Asia and the key trends underlying global political economy and its transformation. The program trains students to analyze political and economic issues in their cultural and social contexts and from a variety of perspectives. The curriculum also helps students understand global issues such as the making of the global order, the rise and fall of hegemony, globalization and inequality, multilateralism and global governance, financial crisis and structural imbalance, as well as climate change. The program focuses especially on how these global factors impact national policy settings in Asian countries.\n\n\n\nThe MA program in TSE draws on different theoretical approaches to political economy, including positive, comparative, and international political economy, development, international and institutional economics, economic history, cultural anthropology, and historical sociology. Courses are taught by internationally renowned scholars in the field and experts with experience in policy making in different parts of Asia. An extensive selection of optional courses is also available, drawing on expertise on the NTHU campus and across the University System of Taiwan (UST). Students will benefit from guest lectures by distinguished speakers, including leading scholars in the field, outstanding public intellectuals, business leaders, and policymakers.\n\n\n\nThe MA program in TSE is quite different from other English MA programs in Taiwan in that 70% of TSE faculty members (both full-time and part-time) are foreign scholars with expertise in Asian political economy and global affairs. They will share their observations and insightful views. Hence, TSE students will learn more about Asian politics and economics not only from Taiwanese scholars but also from scholars from many countries in the world.\n\n\n\nThe award is co-sponsored by the National Tsing Hua University.\n\n\n\n**Grant Length**\n\n\n\n12 Months\n\n\n\n**Grant Period**\n\n\n\nSeptember Start\n\n\n\nThe grant is 12 months.\n\n\n\nGrants must begin in September 2025, prior to the FSE Welcome Reception (usually the Friday after Labor Day).\n\n\n\nThe Grant is initially awarded for 12 months, and renewal for the second year is dependent upon the grantee's academic success with a minimum GPA of 3.0 (B) on a 4.0 scale.\n\n\n\n**Orientation**\n\n\n\nIn-Country Orientation\n\n\n\nThe post-arrival orientation will be held usually the Friday after Labor Day.\"",

        "description": "\"The world is going through an unprecedented healthIn the Region of the Americas, the impact of the pandemic has exacerbated the enormous inequalities and pre-existing inequities (3). Regarding the economic situation of the region, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) projects a decline of 9.1% in gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nLikewise, the unemployment rate has risen to 13.5% in 2020. Also, it is estimated that poverty will  increase by seven percentage points to reach 37, 3%, extreme poverty would increase to 15.5% (4). Regarding the Gini coefficient in the Region, an increase between 1.1% and 7.8% is also estimated (5).\n\nIn the countries of the Region, non-pharmacological public health measures such as home confinement, the closure of schools and businesses, among others, were applied to respond to the pandemic. However, the successful and sustained application of the measures is directly related to the social, economic and cultural conditions of the different population groups and territories. The pandemic has shown that the situation of vulnerability goes beyond individual and biological characteristics and is determined by the social, economic, and political context. Therefore, an effective implementation of public health measures faces multiple obstacles and, on the other hand, generates unwanted or adverse effects (6).\n\nWith the objective of helping to strengthen the conditions that guarantee the application and compliance of non-pharmacological public health measures, especially in groups in vulnerable situations, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has developed a guide called \"Guidance for implementing non pharmacological public health measures in populations in situations of vulnerability in the context of COVID-19\", available in Spanish, English, French and Portuguese. In order to contribute to its implementation, this regional call is an  invitation  to prepare proposals for studies and interventions that promote and strengthen the implementation and the achievement of the objectives proposed in this guide.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal of the Call for proposals To promote and strengthen the implementation of the \"Guidance for implementing non pharmacological public health measures in populations in situations of vulnerability in the context of COVID-19\" (2020, PAHO), in order to ensure that the preventative public health measures can be effectively implemented by the entire population, with  no exclusion.\n\nThis is an invitation to the countries of the region of the Americas to present proposals that promote and strengthen the implementation of the guide: \"Guidance for implementing nonpharmacological public health measures in populations in situations of vulnerability in the context of COVID-19\" .\n\n\n\nProposals on communication and dissemination  of the guide \"Guidance for implementing non pharmacological public health measures in populations in situations of vulnerability in the context of COVID-19\", \n\n\n\nFor a wider implementation of the guide, it needs be disseminated and communicated  in different social groups, contexts and territories. Therefore, communication strategies proposed must consider the social relevance for  the communities where the guide will be  implemented, with special emphasis on populations in vulnerable situations. We welcome  proposals for the development of communication and dissemination materials  for  the guide, in various formats, including  written, digital, video, and others.\"",

The EIR program is designed to generate and validate solutions to persistent education challenges and to support the expansion of those solutions to serve substantially higher numbers of students.\n\n\n\nThe central design element of the EIR program is its multitier structure that links the amount of funding an applicant may receive to the quality of the evidence supporting the efficacy of the proposed project. A goal of the program is for projects that build this evidence to advance through EIR's grant tiers: \"Early-phase,\" \"Mid-phase,\" and \"Expansion.\"\n\n\n\n\"Early-phase,\" \"Mid-phase,\" and \"Expansion\" grants differ in terms of the evidence of effectiveness required to be considered for funding, the expectations regarding the kind of evidence and information funded projects should produce, the scale of funded projects, and, consequently, the amount of funding available to support each type of project.\n\n\n\nExpansion grants are supported by strong evidence\n\n\n\n(as defined in this notice) for at least one population and setting, and grantees are encouraged to implement at the national level (as defined in this notice). Expansion grants provide funding for the implementation and rigorous evaluation of a program that has been found to produce sizable, significant impacts under a Mid-phase grant or other effort meeting similar criteria, for the purposes of (a) determining whether such impacts can be successfully reproduced and sustained over time, and (b) identifying the conditions in which the program is most effective.\n\n\n\nThis notice invites applications for Expansion grants only. The notices inviting applications for Early-phase grants and Mid-phase grants are published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.\n\n\n\nAssistance Listing Number (ALN) 84.411A.\"",

        "description": " Innovation and Technology - K-5 STEM Program Grant\"**INTRODUCTION:**\n\n\n\nThe Nevada Governor's Office of Science, Innovation and Technology (OSIT) was established by the Legislature (NRS 223.600) to grow and improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and STEM workforce development so that Nevada s workforce can meet the demands of its growing economy.\n\nAccording to the research, one-third of boys and girls lose an interest in science by the fourth grade and a child s interest in STEM is largely formed by the time he or she reaches upper elementary and middle school.1 The same research also finds that early exposure to STEM, especially for girls, makes children more likely to succeed in science and pursue STEM fields in college. Yet, just 38% of Nevada s elementary schools report offering STEM during the school day.2 Therefore, if the State s goal is to increase the number of students participating in STEM programs in middle and high schools that prepare them for success in post-secondary STEM degrees and careers, research suggests STEM concepts should first be introduced at the elementary level.3\n\n\n\n**SECTION I: DESIRED OUTCOMES**\n\n\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n\n\nThis grant seeks to promote the equitable access to and increased quality of STEM programs in elementary schools in order to better prepare students for a career pathway to success in the New Nevada. This grant program aligns with four key strategies identified in the State STEM Strategic Plan4.\n\n\n\n1.    To increase the prevalence of evidence-based, high-quality formal and informal STEM practices and programs in Nevada s elementary schools.\n\n\n\n2.    To increase the use of hands-on, evidence-based, experiential STEM learning in grades K-5.\n\n\n\n3.    To increase the percentage of elementary schools that teach science three plus hours per week.\n\n\n\n4.    To increase interest in, awareness of, and achievement in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in grades K-5, particularly amongst demographic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM.\n\n\n\n\"Classroom Awards\" for individuals (up to $2,000) will be used to develop, implement, or enhance specific STEM projects described in the application by the applicant.\n\n\n\n Program Awards  for schools (up to $25,000) will fund costs associated with purchasing, preparing for, and implementing programs on OSIT s STEMList.\"",

Americans will be secure at home only when there is peace and justice abroad.  To this end, we will work, with others:\n\n\n\n-    Toward increasing public awareness of the costs of war,\n\n\n\n-    To restrain our government from intervening, overtly and covertly, in the internal affairs of other nations,\n\n\n\n-    To end the arms race and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons,\n\n\n\n-    To abolish war as an instrument of international policy.\n\n\n\n-    To achieve these goals, members of Veterans For Peace pledge to use non-violent means and to maintain an organization that is democratic.\n\n\n\nIt is with this statement that The Utah Phillips/J. David Singer Chapter 93 of Veterans For Peace offers our Peace Scholarships where since 2006 we have awarded $30,000 in grants (click here for a complete list). To raise funds for the Peace  Scholarships, the thought was given to having an annual concert on John Lennon's October birthday. We wrote John's widow Yoko Ono and just asked her if this was fine with her. A few week later we received a check for $10,000 to start our program! Since that time, our major fundraiser has been an annual John Lennon concert which could only happen with the work of local musician and yearly concert emcee, Chris Buhalis. We also appreciate all the local musicians that Chris lines up for these concerts and urge everyone to take in their concerts and buy their recordings (see https://www.vfp93.org/john-lennon-concert).\n\n\n\nIt is our intent to award a Michigan resident or someone enrolled in a Michigan institute of higher education, who will pursue studies in a Peace Studies program or other program that actively promotes the study of global conflict resolution or issues of peace and justice, a scholarship ranging from $250 to $5000.  You do not need to be a military veteran to apply for the scholarship. It is our hope that the recipient will align their studies with the principles of the Veterans For Peace and propagate the message of peace well beyond their educational endeavors.\"",

        "title": "\"U.S. Mission to South Africa Public Diplomacy Section Call for Proposals to Advance Women in Business",
        "description": " Mitigate Climate ChangeThe Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) of the U.S. Embassy South Africa of the U.S. Department of State announces an open competition for organizations to submit applications to carry out programs in one of six categories outlined in the Program Objectives below. All program proposals must strengthen ties and build relationships between the United States and South Africa and must have a strong, central, American element, or connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s (separate and beyond any involvement with the U.S. Mission or its American Corners or USG exchange program alumni), and have as a primary goal the promotion of increased understanding of U.S. values, perspectives, and policies and relationship building between Americans and South Africans .\n\nPriority Region : Project activities must take place in South Africa, and be directed at South African audiences/participants. The PDS welcomes proposals that reach multiple provinces, or engage in areas outside of Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town.\n\nCOVID-19 : For program proposals that include elements of in-person travel between South Africa and the United States, or other international locations, travel should not be planned until January 2022 at the earliest. All program proposals, including those with exchange components, should include flexibility in planning to adjust given the constantly evolving global and local restrictions related to COVID-19.\n\nAmerican Content : As noted above, successful proposals will include a clear description of the manner in which American content will be included in project implementation, in identifiable, substantive, and meaningful ways. American content may include the use of curricula from a U.S.-based institution, collaboration with an American subject matter expert, or other specific inclusion of a component of U.S. culture, history, or society.\n\nProgram Objectives : The PDS is seeking proposals in the following six categories. An individual or organization may only submit one application, and must identify the category under which they are applying in their proposal.\n\n1. Advancing Women in the Workforce to Achieve Economic Growth\n\nWomen have made significant progress in the political and educational spheres in South Africa, but we recognize that upward mobility in the economic sphere and the inclusion of women in middle and senior management remains a challenge. The PDS seeks proposals that address the gender gap in senior leadership positions in South African businesses. Women are earning college degrees more frequently than men, but they are not in equitable leadership positions in business. This is particularly acute in senior leadership. The PDS seeks proposals for mentorship and other complementary programs that may involve an in-person exchange or summit to address the progress from mid-level managers to the C-suite and as members of Boards of Directors. The target audience will be established professionals in South Africa with the potential to influence significant industry sectors, particularly in private business in South Africa in the next five to ten years. The PDS welcomes proposals that narrow the focus to specific sectors, but encourages proposals that allow for networking across an industry. Proposals should include the option to scale the program to a greater level should funds allow, and should include plans for monitoring and evaluation, and reporting to the PDS over a five to ten year period as the objective of this program is to attain long-term outcomes. Examples of American content may include collaboration with existing U.S. Mission South Africa programs or alumni of USG-funded exchanges.\n\n2. Mitigating Climate Change\n\nThe PDS seeks proposals that will leverage mutual concerns and interests between the United States and South Africa with regard to climate change. Project proposals in this category should identify a specific theme, such as youth engagement, entrepreneurship, or education, that will yield measurable results within the life of the award. Short-term impact may lay the groundwork for long-term impact, but proposals should target a specific audience and intended program participants should be clearly identified. The PDS welcomes proposals that leverage connections between governmental organizations such as the U.S. National Park Service and the South African National Parks or between U.S. and South African higher education institutions. Priority program areas include: sustainable waste management and recycling, urban and peri-urban clean water solutions, countering wildlife trafficking, climate adaptation, urban greening, and healthy oceans\n\n3. Improving Media Literacy and Journalism Training\n\nThe PDS seeks proposals to strengthen fact-checking skills and responsible media consumption in South Africa while targeting high school or university educators and students. Proposals should include a minimum of three elements: 1) a series of engagements with basic-education stakeholders on the importance of including training in critical thinking, fact-checking skills and being a responsible media consumer in the South African public education system; 2) training for high school educators and/or students in fact-checking skills and being a responsible media consumer; 3) similar workshops targeting journalism lecturers and students from universities not already offering elements of training on disinformation or media literacy in their curricula. The PDS will favorably note proposals that aim to establish partnerships with the South African Department of Basic Education and/or specific municipalities and schools to include media literacy or consumption as parts of existing curricula or to otherwise augment relevant discussions at the secondary education level. A program goal should be to encourage fact-checking and responsible media consumption using learned skills or available resources and platforms.\n\n4. Celebrating Black History Month and Promoting Social Justice\n\nThe PDS solicits proposals as part of the broader U.S. Mission South Africa effort to commemorate Black History Month in February 2022. Preference will be given to proposals that open conversations on the shared painful histories of the United States and South Africa, and include opportunities for moderated discussion. Target audiences include university students and professors, journalists, policy makers, and youth. Project activities must include at least one event that would allow participation from U.S. Mission senior leadership in February 2022. Priority program areas are 1) raising awareness of African-American literature, culture, and history with South African audiences; and 2) conducting education outreach to underscore connections between African-Americans' struggle for equality in the United States and South Africa's liberation struggle. Proposals may include use of the arts, such as a performance or series of performances, in-person or virtual, that addresses the African-American experience and linkages to the South African experience. Proposals that target audiences at outlying universities, TVETs, and rural community centers are encouraged. Competitive proposals will demonstrate how the activities will resonate with South African audiences.\n\n5. Countering Gender-Based Violence to Improve Security\n\nThe PDS seeks proposals that address policy, advocacy, and/or social structures that affect Gender-Based Violence in South Africa using lessons learned from the United States. Program proposals should ensure that any action funded by the U.S. government complements the Presidentially-approved National Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Strategic Plan. Priority program areas include: incorporating youth and prevention efforts to ensure young men are actively involved in the dialogue and solution; facilitating robust discussions with traditional, cultural and religious leaders; creating programs for young men and mentorship programs for boys to address toxic masculinity and provide healthy role models. Target audiences include policy influencers at the national and municipality level, youth, university students and faculty, and journalists. Collaboration with existing U.S. Mission South Africa programs or alumni of USG-funded exchanges is encouraged. Competitive proposals will leverage linkages with the United States while tailoring programming to the immediate situation in South Africa.\n\n6. Expanding the University Partnership Initiative\n\nThe PDS seeks proposals for programs focused on strengthening existing ties and fostering new collaboration between U.S. and South African universities under the University Partnership Initiative (UPI). Priority program areas include promoting faculty and student exchanges, facilitating joint research, building administrative capacity, and creating public-private partnerships. Program proposals should address how relationships between institutions will be sustained after U.S. government funded efforts are concluded. Proposals in this category should include the option to scale to a greater level should funds allow, and should address potential significant involvement by the PDS as a likely Cooperative Agreement (see Section B/Funding Instrument Type). Collaboration with existing U.S. Mission South Africa programs or alumni of USG-funded exchanges is encouraged. Priority program areas include: promoting U.S.-South Africa faculty and student exchanges, particularly the development of dual degree programs that have South Africans complete their studies in their home country and address South Africa's shortage of qualified academic staff; facilitating early-career training for academics; joint research, especially in agriculture, food security, health, and STEM; providing training and transfer skills in all aspects of university and community college administration through subject-matter exchange programs; exploring public-private partnerships, with an emphasis on commercialization, technology transfer, and job creation. The intended audience is South African community college and university students, university administrators, corporations, the NGO sector, and USG-funded exchange program alumni. Proposals that address linkages between South African technical universities and their American counterparts are strongly encouraged. Programs that create or grow linkages between academia and commerce are also encouraged.\n\nPlease read the full announcement before submitting an application. All application materials must be submitted by email to PretoriaGrants@state.gov.\n\nQuestion and Answer Opportunity : The PDS hosted a virtual question and answer session for potential applicants on May 6. A recording of the session is available on our website at https://za.usembassy.gov/notice-of-funding-opportunity-pas-zaf-fy21-05/ .\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-23-205  \n**Research Objectives**\n\n\n\nThe mission of the National Eye Institute (NEI) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. The NEI invites applications for research that aligns with our [strategic plan.](https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning) The purpose of this program is to accelerate the development of biological, pharmacological, medical device, and/or combination product interventions for clinicians to use in the treatment of visual system diseases and disorders. In the context of this program, the PD/PI assembles a multi-disciplinary research team that employs an integrative approach to the rapid and efficient translation of laboratory research findings into IND or IDE applications to the FDA for testing new therapeutic approaches. The collaborative teams must include as appropriate, non-clinical and clinical scientists, disease experts, regulatory experts, bioethics specialists, experts in manufacturing under Quality Systems and Design Controls, and other relevant academic, clinical, and/or industry experts.\n\n\n\nThis program is not intended to support solely basic science, platform technologies or isolated technology development. The goal is to produce preclinical data that will support an IND or IDE application to the FDA. Each project must have a well-defined end point, of developing a new device or treatment for a specific ocular disease that is achievable within a three-year time frame. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a therapeutic or device that can be tested in a clinical trial.\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n\nThis NOFO will utilize a milestone-driven R33 mechanism. Applicants are strongly encouraged to use project management principles to help facilitate achievement of performance milestones as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe R33 phase can be up to three years and will support research that is in the final states of preclinical development with potential for near-term clinical development. The R33 is to focus on advancing a single therapeutic candidate through IND/IDE -enabling studies, filing an IND/IDE package with the FDA, and designing future clinical trials. R33 recipients must submit or obtain an Investigational New Drug/Investigational Device Exemption (IND/IDE) application to FDA, or must transition the product to clinical practice, within the period of performance. The specific activities appropriate for the R33 phase will depend on the product under study and available preliminary data on the product.Examples of activities that can be supported during the Developmental (R33) stage include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  cGMP manufacturing of material for IND-enabling and/or Phase I clinical testing\n\n-  IND/IDE-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to determine a basis for clinical dose extrapolation using a relevant animal model\n\n-  IND/IDE document preparation and filing with the FDA  \n\n\n\nEvidence of a pre-IND/IDE meeting with the FDA is required to submit an R33 application. Applicants that have not achieved this requirement or are not ready for this late stage of product development should consider the companion (R61/R33) NOFO [PAR-23-200](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-200.html).\n\n\n\nMilestones\n\n\n\nDelineation of milestones by the applicant is a key characteristic of this NOFO. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline that signifies the completion of a major project stage or activity. This NOFO will support applications that propose a series of milestones including manufacturing and product development goals. Applications that address contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays in meeting the milestones are strongly encouraged. Milestones must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). \n\n\n\nPrior to funding an application, program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones. The Program Director and the applicant will negotiate and agree on a final set of milestones. These will be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the award and will be the basis for evaluating the progress on the project.\n\n\n\nNon-Responsiveness Criteria\n\n\n\nThe following types of applications will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn prior to review: \n\n\n\n-  Applications that do not address the NEI mission and Strategic Plan\n\n-  Applications that do not propose R33 milestones\n\n-  Applications that propose development of research infrastructure\n\n-  Clinical Trials are not supported by this NOFO including:\n\n-  Phase I (first-in-human) trials\n\n-  Observational studies that do not meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial\n\n-  Multi-site trials\n\n-  Drug or device safety trials\n\n-  Basic Experimental Studies in Humans (BESH)  \n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

The volume of data currently is many-fold larger compared to just two years ago. In science there are many intermediate data objects being created through the phases of research activities and they are managed within the research data lifecycle in which curation and preservation are key elements to make accessible data that are interoperable and reusable. Costs and physical limitations of storage and service capacity lead to the difficult question of what is worth long term preserving narrowing the selection to data and other digital objects that will have long-term benefits to science and society.\n\n\n\nCoordination to harmonise practices and standards within and across the different scientific fields and adequate infrastructures are necessary to implement the level of curation and preservation needed and to offer the related services that differ in practice and effort per discipline ant type of data.\n\n\n\nConsidering that European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) aims at addressing many of the challenges faced when dealing with ensuring the long-term preservation of data along with the growing uptake of FAIR principles, the proposals under this topic are expected to:\n\n\n\n-   Establish a minimum set of practices and a general framework to identify what data is candidate to long term preservation based on their use, benefit and quality.\n\n-   Support the creation of long-term preservation and access strategies and processes among the different scientific disciplines.\n\n-   Engage and collaborate with domain specific networks, creating new ones where necessary, that will consolidate practices and standards, such as metadata and ontologies, that will strengthen long-term access and preservation and support reproducibility, integrity and validity.\n\n-   Build upon existing services and enrich EOSC with tools to store and access digital data for long periods, automate and federate certain specialised curation and preservation tasks.\n\n-   Create an expert curation network (discipline oriented) that will enhance and facilitate the curation process and the digital preservation actions to ensure data remain accessible as technology changes.\n\n-   Identify within EOSC and consolidate a network of repositories and archives for long-term preservation to address economy of scale and better support the European science ecosystem. Such network will have to be a superset of the network of trusted repositories of which the development and coordination will be supported under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2024-EOSC-01-03.\n\n-   Capitalise on the results of the ARCHIVER project and address sustainability solutions to ensure long-term preservation services in the EOSC ecosystem.\n\n\n\nWithin the action of establishing \"a minimum set of practices and a general framework to identify what data is candidate to long term preservation\" the quality of the data is a factor that plays a pivotal role in developing strategies that will support the decision of what is worth to preserve for long-term. The technical quality of data is related to the structure of the information objects, their adherence to standards, the use of commonly identified formats and the completeness of metadata that describes it. On a deeper level, quality is also the assessment of its  fitness  for the intended scope and further reuse. Quality assessment to support preservation has to primarily consider the effective contribution of data for the intended end point and the need of long term access but also the intra- and cross-disciplinary interest for reuse in other contexts and the richness of documentation that enables reuse. Technical soundness is a necessary but not sufficient discriminant and other quality assessments need to be based on set of evaluation principles and indicators that need to be developed and largely adopted by the different scientific disciplines. Therefore, the proposals under this topic are additionally expected to:\n\n\n\n-   Coordinate disciplinary networks where wide representations of universities, research performing organisations, digital repositories, building on existing practices, will\n\n    -   Develop, and promote guidelines to produce high quality data;\n\n    -   Agree on standards to assess the quality of data and\n\n    -   Widely promote the above among the European research ecosystem.\n\n-   Define, with experts from the disciplinary networks common requirements for data quality that are valid across disciplines.\n\n\n\nThe selected proposals will be expected to align with the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate an collaborate with the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2024-EOSC-01-03 with regards to the interconnection of repositories and other archiving infrastructure, and with the projects funder the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02, especially with regards to the quality dimension explored under that topic.\n\n\n\n**Topic destination**\n\n\n\nEnabling an operational, open and fair EOSC ecosystem (INFRAEOSC) (2023/24)\n\n\n\nThe European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) is an ecosystem of research data and related services. It encompasses rules of engagement, standards, abstractions, technologies, and services, which will enable and enhance seamless access to and reliable re-use of FAIR\\[\\[ Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, [https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)\\]\\] research outputs (i.e. data and other digital objects), including those generated or collected by other research infrastructures, and covering the whole research data life cycle (generation, storage, sharing and publishing, discovery, access, processing, management, analysis, re-use, etc.). The EOSC will contribute to the European Strategy for Data, including its thematic common interoperable data spaces, and the provision of secure and FAIR-enabling European cloud services.\n\n\n\nEOSC development has been supported through a series of Horizon 2020 projects and an interim EOSC governance structure preparing the next stage of EOSC development for the period after 2020. These projects have contributed to the creation of a pan-European access mechanism; coordination of national activities for EOSC on-boarding; connection of European research infrastructures (e.g. ERIC and other world-class RIs) and existing e-infrastructures; initial development and operationalisation of the FAIR principles and a FAIR-compliant certification scheme for research data; the EOSC portal providing access to a range of services, guidelines and training; and the development and provision of a number of research-enabling value-added services, including distributed data processing and management (both public and commercial). From 2021, the EOSC partnership will help ensuring directionality (common vision and objectives) and additionality (complementary commitments and contributions) of the stakeholders involved.\n\n\n\nBuilding on this progress, the INFRAEOSC destination aims to continue to develop the EOSC in a more cohesive and structured manner so that it becomes a fully operational enabling ecosystem for the whole research data lifecycle. This ecosystem includes FAIR research data commons (e.g. data, services, tools), based on key horizontal core functions, with corresponding e-infrastructures and service layers accessible to researchers across disciplines throughout Europe, leading to a \"Web of FAIR Data and Services\" for Science. The EOSC ecosystem will contribute a data space for science, research and innovation articulated with the other data spaces described in the European Strategy for Data.\n\n\n\nExpected impact\n\n\n\nProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to one or several of the following impacts:\n\n\n\n-   Transforming the way researchers as well as the public and private sectors create, share and exploit research outputs (data, publications, protocols, methodologies, software, code, etc.) within and across research disciplines, leading to better quality, validation, more innovation and higher productivity of research;\n\n-   Facilitating scientific multi-disciplinary cooperation, leading to discoveries in basic research and solutions in key application areas;\n\n-   Seamless access to and management of increasing volumes of research data following FAIR principles (that are open as possible) and other research outputs stimulating the development and uptake of a wide range of new innovative and value-added services from public and commercial providers\n\n-   Improving trust in science through increased FAIRness, openness and quality of scientific research in Europe, supported by more meaningful monitoring and better facilitators for reproducibility, validation and re-use of research results, and by improving pathways for the communication of science to the public.\n\n\n\nAll software developed under this destination should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source licence as recommended by the Free Software Foundation\\[\\[ [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicenses)\\]\\] and the Open Source Initiative\\[\\[ [https://opensource.org/licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)\\]\\].\n\n\n\nAll projects that will be financed under this destination are expected to participate in concertation activities in the framework of the EOSC Partnership.\"",

        "title": "\"Next Generation Innovation Talents\"",
        "description": "\"Objective:  \nThe objective of the 'Next Generation Innovation Talents' scheme is to enable researchers and aspiring innovators to better understand and gain direct experience of the complex process of taking innovation beyond invention and help them develop their entrepreneurial mindset. At the same time, this scheme aims to provide innovative start-ups with access to new ideas and insights from the cutting edge of research, thus accelerating the development of their breakthrough products and services.  \n\n\n\nThe scheme will allow eligible researchers to carry out an innovation internship in a hosting company, and will be open to:  \n\n\n\n\\- As hosting companies: start-ups and SMEs supported by the EIC Accelerator (including H2020 SME instrument), EIC awarded Seal of Excellence companies, SMEs/ start-ups in EIC Transition; as well as start-ups/SMEs supported by EIT-KIC innovation and business creation services, including those created as a result of receiving support from KICs; the startups / scaleups that have been created out of KICs Innovation activities; the startups / scaleups / SMEs that have been partners of KICs for Innovation activities; the startups / scaleups that have at least one co-founder who is an EIT Alumni member  \n\n\\- As researchers eligible for internships: PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers participating in: projects funded by the European Research Council (ERC); the EIC Pathfinder; the Marie Sklodowska Sk odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) postdoctoral fellowships, doctoral networks and COFUND programmes; the Research Infrastructures part of Horizon Europe, and relevant students in (and graduates from) EIT Label Masters and Doctoral programmes, EIT Alumni and EIT Jumpstarter beneficiaries and participants from other postdoctoral training programmes supported by the EIT KICs.   \n\nAdditional partner programmes, including international partner programmes, may be included in eligibility for the internship in agreement between the Commission, the beneficiary of this call and the partner programme.  \n\n\n\nThe winner of this call (hereafter 'Beneficiary') can be a single legal entity or a consortium of legal entities. The scheme will be implemented by the beneficiary in close cooperation with each of the original funding schemes (partner programmes) of the researchers (MSCA, EIT, ERC, EIC Pathfinder, the Research Infrastructure part of Horizon Europe). The costs of the internships will be covered by the partner programmes (with exception of ERC), in line with their work programmes. The hosting companies will not provide any direct payment to the interns. It is expected that approximately 600 innovation internships will be supported under this action, of approximately three to six months each, over a two-year period.  \n\n\n\nScope:  \n\nThe Scheme has two main streams:  \n\n\n\n\\- Deep tech talents: Internship duration of 3 to 6 months open to PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers currently working for ERC, EIC Pathfinder, MSCA, EIT and Research Infrastructure actions. These internships will be dedicated to highly specialised work on specific project or assistance to a senior executive (CEO, CTO, CSO) as requested by the hosting company.  \n\n\\- Aspiring innovators: Internship duration of up to 6 months open to relevant students in (and graduates from) EIT Label Masters and Doctoral programmes, EIT Alumni, EIT Jumpstarter beneficiaries. These internships are for less specialist work experience in the host organisation.   \n\nThe actions under this call should include as minimum the following key tasks:  \n\n\n\n\\- Support to the preparation and implementation of call(s) for expression(s) of interest to eligible researchers/ research organisations and eligible companies in coordination with the EU partner programmes;  \n\n\\- Creation of a matchmaking IT platform between interested researchers (candidate interns) and companies;  \n\n\\- Provision of guidance and support for candidate interns and companies;  \n\n\\- Handling of agreements with the research institutes and the companies, including standard agreements on intellectual property, conditions of work etc.;  \n\n\\- Follow up on any practical issues related to the internships;   \n\n\\- Organisation of information and dissemination campaigns;  \n\n\\- When relevant, organisation of financial support to internships to cover additional costs of interns (financial support to third parties, see below);  \n\n\\- Regular reporting back to each respective EU funding programme, companies and interns;  \n\n\\- Provision of feedback on the effectiveness and impact of scheme (e.g. through surveys, focus groups);   \n\nThe selection of internships to benefit from this action should include the following procedure:  \n\n\n\nStep 1: call for expression of interest to eligible companies to host internships. The proposed internships must be assessed for their suitability and relevance to the objectives of this scheme   \n\n\n\nStep 2: call for expression of interest to eligible researchers to participate in the proposed internships.  \n\n\n\nStep 3: matchmaking between the researchers and the internship positions in the host companies. Applicants must specify in their proposals how they intend to undertake this matchmaking (which criteria, how to ensure a geographical and gender balance, etc). The application and matchmaking process must be lean and agile, creating as less as possible administrative burden for the applicants and the companies.  \n\n\n\nThe interns selected for the internships must have the necessary approvals from their institutions and project leaders/ Principal Investigators to participate in the scheme (when relevant).   \n\n\n\nFinancial support to third parties  \n\n\n\nThe reimbursements of the internship expenses for the researchers funded by MSCA, HE Research Infrastructure, EIT/EIT KICs will be borne by the respective partner programmes.  \n\n\n\nThe beneficiary may provide financial support to third parties (ERC and EIC Pathfinder researchers).  \n\n\n\nAt least 50 percent of the total budget for this action must be allocated through financial support to third parties in form of grants (lump sums). The maximum amount to be granted to a third party is EUR [15 900].  \n\n\n\nFor researchers working on ERC actions, the expenses incurred for the internship will not be eligible under the ERC grant, and all costs will be reimbursed as financial support to third parties under this action. The amount will be a flat monthly reimbursement of EUR 4300 for PhD students and EUR 5300 for Postdoctoral researcher[1] for a maximum period 3 months (the internships may be of a longer period but without additional reimbursements through this action).  \n\n\n\nFor researchers working on EIC Pathfinder actions, the personal costs are eligible under the Pathfinder grant (as specified in Section II). An additional mobility allowance will be reimbursed as financial support to third parties under this action. To be eligible for this mobility allowance, the location of the internship must be more than [150km] from the location of the normal place of work of the researcher. The amount will be a flat monthly allowance of EUR 2300 per month for a maximum period of 3 months (the internships may be of a longer period but without additional reimbursements through this action).  \n\n\n\nThe beneficiary must ensure sound financial management and applicants must specify in their proposals how the management and control of this financial support will be organised in an effective and efficient way, including avoidance of any abuse.  \n\nExpected Impact:  \n\n\\- Support to at least 600 internships (deep tech talents and aspiring innovators) over the duration of the action. The final number of participants per programme may vary based on demand but assuming high demand from all partner programmes, there should be a minimum of 150 researchers from EIC Pathfinder actions  \n\n\\- Increased awareness and knowledge of researchers about potential career paths in startup companies or for creating their own companies;  \n\n\\- Improved access to research talent by EIC and EIT supported startups and SMEs.  \n\n\\- Increased visibility of the scheme, highlighting the role, funding instruments and opportunities provided by EIC and other EU partner programmes;  \n\n\\- High quality assessment of the impact of the scheme, including feedback from internees and host companies, and recommendations for further development of the scheme   \n\nThe applicant must provide in its proposal SMART key performance indicators (KPI) to measure the expected impact. These KPIs must measure as minimum: number of matches and internships, impact and satisfaction rates (companies and interns).  \n\n\n\nFor general award criteria please check Annex 2.  \n\n\n\n[1]The monthly lump sum reimbursements are baes on the respective rates for MSCA PhD and Postdoctoral living and mobility allowances.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-24-138  \n****Purpose and Background Information****  \n\n\n\nThe overall goal of the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. More information about NRSA programs can be found at the [Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.php?id=41125) website. The NRSA program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the NRSA legislation in 1974. \n\n\n\nEach NIGMS funded NRSA program is expected to provide a rigorous, well-designed research training program that includes mentored research experiences, courses, seminars, and additional training opportunities to equip trainees with the following skills required for careers in the biomedical research workforce:\n\n\n\n-  Technical (for example, appropriate methods, technologies, and quantitative/computational approaches).\n\n-  Operational (for example, independent knowledge acquisition, rigorous experimental design, interpretation of data, and conducting research in the safest manner possible).\n\n-  Professional (for example, management, leadership, communication, and teamwork).\n\n\n\n****Need for the Program****  \n\n\n\nAdvances in biomedical research depend upon a workforce composed of people trained in multiple disciplines and from different backgrounds who can provide the breadth of creativity, and individual interests, perspectives and experiences needed to identify and address important and complex scientific problems. Research shows that teams with members from different backgrounds that utilize their members' unique experiences and perspectives better capitalize on innovative ideas and outperform homogenous teams. There are many benefits that flow from an NIH-supported scientific workforce that leverages the talents of rigorous researchers from all backgrounds: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of research, enhancing public trust, and increasing the likelihood that health disparities and the needs of underserved populations are addressed in biomedical research (for more information, see [Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)). The NIH recognizes the need to promote broad participation in the scientific workforce, including by encouraging institutions to enhance the participation of individuals from groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce through means consistent with applicable law. NIGMS strives to ensure that future researchers will be drawn from the entire pool of potential contributors and seeks to expand opportunities to contribute to the biomedical research workforce by supporting individuals from a variety of backgrounds at multiple training and career stages in a variety of organizational settings across the country. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, individuals from certain groups and backgrounds often face organizational and environmental barriers that restrict their potential to advance their training and careers, and are underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce. For example:\n\n\n\n-  Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander comprise ~39% of the college age population, but earn only ~25% of bachelor's degrees and ~17% of Ph.D. degrees in the life sciences (as per data from the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html), the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/datatools/), and the [National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics](https://ncses.nsf.gov/explore-data)). Additionally, increases in the numbers of biomedical Ph.Ds. awarded to scientists from these groups are not reflected at the faculty level ([Gibbs, et al., eLife 2016](https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393)) or in NIH funded K awardees or Research Project Grant investigators ([Lauer and Bernard, 2023a](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2023/03/16/mentored-career-development-application-k-funding-rates-by-race-ethnicity-fy-2010-fy-2022/), [2023b](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2023/03/16/analyses-of-demographic-specific-funding-rates-for-type-1-research-project-grant-and-r01-equivalent-applications/)).\n\n-  The representation of scientists with disabilities decreases from 19% for undergraduate students to 9% of doctoral students and fewer than 2% of NIH and NSF-funded principal investigators ([NIH ACD WGD Subgroup on Individuals with Disabilities Report, 2022](https://www.acd.od.nih.gov/documents/presentations/12092022_WGD_Disabilities_Subgroup_Report.pdf)).\n\n-  Individuals from certain disadvantaged backgrounds, for example those from families from the lowest socioeconomic quintile, were 50% less likely than those from the highest socioeconomic quintile to enroll in post secondary education, limiting subsequent access to doctoral education (see [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf)).\n\n\n\nAuthentic research experiences, both course-based and in the context of a research group, are a critical component of undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education as they can support student mastery of scientific concepts, development of a professional scientific identity, and persistence in STEM degree programs ([Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education, 2018](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24943/indicators-for-monitoring-undergraduate-stem-education)). While authentic research experiences are beneficial for all students, they are particularly helpful for strengthening STEM disciplinary identity and belonging among students from historically underrepresented groups and first generation students ([Barriers and Opportunities for 2-Year and 4-Year STEM Degrees, 2016](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/21739/barriers-and-opportunities-for-2-year-and-4-year-stem-degrees)). However, first generation students, low-income students, and students from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are less likely to participate in undergraduate research for multiple reasons, including a lack of awareness about undergraduate research or how to access such opportunities, financial barriers, and lack of scientific mentorship ([Undergraduate Research Experiences for STEM Students, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24622/undergraduate-research-experiences-for-stem-students-successes-challenges-and-opportunities)). \n\n\n\nImportantly, access to structured and formalized programs that provide financial support, high quality mentoring, robust peer and professional networks, and opportunities for skills development have been linked to higher levels of persistence in undergraduate training programs, as well as improved STEM degree completion rates, increased self-efficacy, strengthened science identity, and enhanced commitment to a research career ([Indicators for Monitoring Undergraduate STEM Education, 2018](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24943/indicators-for-monitoring-undergraduate-stem-education); [The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEMM, 2019](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25568/the-science-of-effective-mentorship-in-stemm)). Therefore, there remains a strong need to develop additional opportunities to address these challenges and ensure undergraduate research training programs effectively support the skills and career development of students from all backgrounds.\n\n\n\n****Program Objective****  \n\n\n\nThe **Overarching Objective** of the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) (T34) program is to promote broad participation in the biomedical research workforce by strengthening research training environments and expanding the pool of well-trained students who:\n\n\n\n-  Complete their baccalaureate degree, and\n\n-  Transition into and complete biomedical, research-focused higher degree programs (such as Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.).\n\n\n\nThe program should provide trainees with the following:\n\n\n\n-  A broad exposure to foundational biomedical disciplines.\n\n-  The skills to acquire the knowledge needed to advance their chosen fields and careers.\n\n-  The ability to think critically about important biomedical research questions and approaches that push forward the boundaries of their areas of study.\n\n-  A strong foundation in scientific reasoning, rigorous research design, experimental methods, quantitative and computational approaches, and data analysis and interpretation.\n\n-  The skills to conduct research in the safest manner possible, and a commitment to approaching and conducting biomedical research responsibly, ethically, and with integrity.\n\n-  Experiences conducting, interpreting, and presenting rigorous and reproducible biomedical research with increasing self-direction.\n\n-  The ability to work effectively in teams with colleagues from a variety of cultural and scientific backgrounds, and to promote inclusive and supportive scientific research environments.\n\n-  The skills to communicate scientific methodologies and findings to a wide variety of audiences (for example, discipline-specific, across disciplines, and for the public).\n\n-  The knowledge, professional skills and experiences required to identify and transition into careers in the biomedical research workforce (for example, the breadth of careers that sustain biomedical research in areas that are relevant to the NIH mission).\n\n\n\n****Program Considerations****  \n\n\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to read information about the MARC program found on the [NIGMS website](https://nigms.nih.gov/research-areas/areas-of-research/training-workforce-development-and-diversity) and to contact program staff **before** preparing or submitting an application to verify that the proposed program is eligible and in alignment with NIGMS funding priorities.\n\n\n\n***General Considerations:*** Consistent with existing NIGMS practices and applicable law:\n\n\n\n-  Funded programs may not use the race, ethnicity, or sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, or transgender status) of a trainee or faculty candidate as an eligibility or selection criteria.\n\n-  NIGMS does not use the race, ethnicity, or sex of trainee candidates, trainees, or faculty in the application review process or funding decisions. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, there are many permissible activities to promote broad participation in the biomedical research workforce, and to encourage the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups. For example:\n\n\n\n-  Outreach activities to foster awareness of research training opportunities for potential trainees from all backgrounds.\n\n-  Targeted recruitment activities to diversify program applicant pools.\n\n-  Program admissions processes that consider factors beyond grade point average and standardized test scores - such as how a trainee candidate's lived experiences and perspectives further their commitment to program goals and a biomedical research career.\n\n-  Efforts to create and sustain inclusive research training environments for trainees from diverse backgrounds, for example strengthening faculty skills to work effectively with trainees from various cultural and neurodiverse groups.\n\n-  Updating curricula, pedagogy, and academic supports to enhance student success and engagement.\n\n-  Expanding mentoring, networking, and skills development opportunities, and financial support for trainees.\n\n-  Utilizing data to identify, and as appropriate, feasibly address biases and barriers in the research training environment that impede trainee success.\n\n\n\nApplicants and award recipients are encouraged to consult with their General Counsel to ensure all applicable laws and regulations are being followed in program design and implementation. \n\n\n\nNIGMS intends to fund applications that propose feasible, rigorous, well-designed research training programs that will build on the most effective elements of successful programs while furthering the goal of the MARC program. For the purpose of this announcement, organizations are encouraged to recruit prospective candidates from groups underrepresented on the national basis to grow and diversify the program applicant pool. In addition, because underrepresentation can vary from setting to setting, organizations should design a recruitment strategy to promote broad participation based on their local context as well as on national needs. \n\n\n\nPrograms are expected to be tailored to the organizational context, for example by using data to identify specific strengths and areas of improvement in the training environment, and developing strategies that leverage organizational strengths to address areas of need. Programs should not simply layer additional activities onto existing structures, but instead should use creative and transformational approaches to undergraduate biomedical research training, mentoring practices, and enhancing departmental and organizational capacity to create and sustain inclusive research training environments.\n\n\n\nNIGMS training programs that aim to promote broad participation in the biomedical research workforce are intended to provide research training opportunities to students from the breadth of biomedical disciplines at the organization. Proposed programs focused on a single biomedical discipline or approach at an organization with multiple biomedically relevant departments will be a low priority for funding.\n\n\n\nNIGMS recognizes the heterogeneity of trainee pathways from undergraduate education toward research-focused higher degree programs (such as Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.). Some students complete undergraduate education and transition immediately to such programs. Other students have pathways that include longer time frames to incorporate additional experiences such as postbaccalaureate training, research-based master's degrees, or time away from biomedical research training. NIGMS intends to fund programs that support undergraduates completing their baccalaureate degrees and undertaking the appropriate next step toward the ultimate goal of transitioning to and completing a research-focused higher degree program. \n\n\n\nFunded programs are expected to:\n\n\n\n-  Be well integrated within one or more department(s)/program(s) and exert a strong, positive influence at the organizational level on undergraduate biomedical research training and mentoring practices.\n\n-  Have clearly defined training objectives that take into account the applicant organization's specific context, resources, and strengths, and show evidence of meeting the objectives in progress reports and in renewal applications.\n\n-  Implement evidence-informed training and mentoring activities (for example, approaches grounded in the literature and evaluations of existing relevant research training programs). Programs are expected to be responsive to evaluations, particularly with respect to trainee feedback.\n\n-  Provide rigorous, well-designed mentored authentic research experiences (including at least one summer research experience (SRE)), and additional opportunities that will build a strong cohort of research-oriented individuals. Programs are expected to assist students in identifying and arranging the SREs to broaden and deepen their research training (for additional details, see [SRE policy](https://nigms.nih.gov/training/T34)). Training grant funds may not be used solely as a vehicle to provide financial aid for trainees to conduct research.\n\n-  Demonstrate effective oversight of trainee development and promote retention for the entire time the trainee is in the undergraduate program. Retention efforts are activities designed to sustain the scientific interests and participation of trainees from all backgrounds. Retention and oversight activities might include monitoring academic and research progress, building strong trainee cohorts, as well as increasing science identity, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging within research training environments. Programs are expected to make efforts to identify individuals who may need additional academic and social supports to successfully complete the program, and ensure they receive the needed support.\n\n-  Promote inclusive, safe, accessible, and supportive research training environments to maximize success for all individuals in the training program. Specifically, funded programs should have organizational and departmental environments where individuals from all backgrounds are welcomed, feel integrated into, and supported by the biomedical research community. Safety in research training should encompass (1) environments free from harassment, discrimination, and intimidation, in which all are treated in a respectful and supportive manner, (2) laboratory and clinical settings where individuals exercise the highest standards of practice for chemical, biological and physical safety, and (3) practices at the organizational leadership and research community levels that demonstrate core values and behaviors to emphasize safety over competing goals.\n\n\n\n***Trainee Support:*** The training grant defrays the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training-related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with the approved [NIH NRSA support levels](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/resources/policy-notices). Students are typically provided full-time support for 2-3 years of undergraduate biomedical research training. Thus, NIGMS expects that organizations will identify trainee candidates who, with satisfactory progress, can complete the entire 2-3 year training experience and be re-appointed after their initial appointment. Training grant funds are not intended to support short-term undergraduate biomedical research training.\n\n\n\nUse of training grant support in the final three years of undergraduate research training is **strongly** encouraged to allow trainees to participate in authentic research experiences, courses, professional development and cohort-building activities that will prepare them to successfully transition into a biomedical, research-focused higher degree program (for example, Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D.). New trainee cohorts are typically appointed in each year of the proposed program. \n\n\n\n***Synergies of Federally Funded Training Programs:*** Funded research training programs are encouraged to complement and synergize with other ongoing federally supported research training programs at the applicant organization; however, the research training goals must be distinct from related, federally funded programs at the same organization. In cases where an organization has multiple NIGMS training grants, it is expected that these programs will work together to create administrative and training efficiencies to reduce costs and improve trainee services and outcomes.\n\n\n\n***Type of Application Submissions:*** Please note the following before applying:\n\n\n\n-  Applications will be considered a **RENEWAL** application only if the program described in the application was funded through [PAR-19-219](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-19-219.html) or [PAR-21-147](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-147.html).\n\n-  **RESUBMISSION applications are only accepted for RENEWAL applications**.\n\n    -  Renewal applications that are not funded on the initial attempt may be revised and resubmitted as a Resubmission application (i.e., -A1).\n\n    -  ***New applications that are not funded are not allowed to submit a Resubmission application***. Instead, applicants whose New applications were not funded are encouraged to apply again by submitting another New application that utilizes constructive feedback from the previous review while following the instructions for New applications (that is, do not refer to the prior application or critiques).\n\n\n\n***Clinical Trials:*** This NOFO does not allow appointed trainees to lead an independent clinical trial but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. NIH strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research; gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

        "description": "\"When Jake and Shirley Bostrom think about their daughterThey established the Kari Jo Bostrom Memorial Fund at the Community Foundation of Dunn County to support programs specific to causes that were close to Kari's heart.  A 1989 graduate of Menomonie High School, Kari attended Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology, Art and Museum Studies.  She went on to work for the Wilson Place Museum and the Rassbach Museum in Menomonie for several years.  Kari continued her education at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota, earning advanced degrees in Church History and theological research degree in History.  While earning these degrees, Kari began work in the Luther Seminary Arts and Archives program, where she soon found a passion and unique ability for historical preservation and service to researchers.\n\n\n\nThe Kari Jo Bostrom Memorial Fund helps provide teacher mini grants for the School District of the Menomonie Area, as part of the Excellence in Education Teacher Mini Grant Program managed by the Community Foundation of Dunn County.  Competitive grants ranging from $250 to $1,000 are available to school staff each year through an application process, to support school projects that promote learning and improve the academic achievement of students. \n\n\n\nThis particular fund supports requests for projects that enhance children's experiences in areas that Kari was passionate about, including historical experiences or research, field trips to area museums or veterans' memorials, or projects that immerse students into various cultures or the arts.\n\n\n\nThe first mini-grant funded by the Kari Bostrom Memorial Fund was in the amount of $1,000 and allowed the Menomonie School District to purchase non-fiction picture-book display bins for their five elementary schools.  The project, submitted by the K-5 Library Media Technology Integrator, Jessica Graham, aimed to accommodate elementary students of all reading abilities by displaying non-fiction books face-out, giving students the ability to see both the picture and title of books more easily.  The 2019 Kari Jo Bostrom Memorial Fund - Teacher Mini Grant was in the amount of $1,000 and was awarded to support a Holocaust Presentation to the 7th grade student body.\"",

        "title": "\"U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Postdoctoral Fellowship on Development and Characterization of a Phage Therapy to Decolonize Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci\"",
        "description": "\"**Description**\n***Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis, and this opportunity will remain open until filled.**\n\n\n\nA research opportunity is currently available in the Office of Vaccine Research and Review (OVRR) at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\n\n\nSince the advent of antibiotics in the 1920s, these drugs have saved millions of people from diseases such as pneumonias, healthcare associated infections, and foodborne illnesses. However, the continued use of antibiotics has led to several unintended consequences, including disruption of the indigenous beneficial gut bacteria and a rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 23,000 deaths are caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, and these organisms constitute a growing problem worldwide. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which have been classified as a serious threat by the CDC, are responsible for 20,000 U.S. infections annually. The inability to treat these infections with common antibiotics necessitates the development of alternative methods of intervention.\n\n\n\nA postdoc fellow appointment is available on projects designed to assess the potential of bacteriophage therapies against Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus species. The objective of this project is to develop and characterize an effective bacteriophage therapy against VRE, including both vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium. The project will include mouse model development as well as assessment of bacteriophage efficacy and pharmacokinetics in these model systems. Additional studies will determine mutations that result in bacterial resistance against bacteriophage and understanding how to overcome this resistance to generate a successful therapeutic. Studies are also ongoing to assess the impact of phage specific host immunity on the overall efficacy of phage therapeutics. These studies will have a significant impact on a largely understudied field and contribute to solving the problem presented by the continued increase in antimicrobial resistant infections worldwide.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible**\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. **The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds.** The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.\n\n\n\nCompletion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.\n\n\n\n**FDA Ethics Requirements**\n\n\n\nIf an ORISE Fellow, to include their spouse and minor children, reports what is identified as a Significantly Regulated Organization (SRO) or prohibited investment fund financial interest in any amount, or a relationship with an SRO, except for spousal employment with an SRO, and the individual will not voluntarily divest the financial interest or terminate the relationship, then the individual is not placed at FDA. For additional requirements, see [FDA Ethics for Nonemployee Scientists](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fabout-fda%2Foffice-chief-scientist%2Ffda-ethics-non-employee-scientists&data=05%7C01%7CRachel.Creager%40orau.org%7C470db107787847ec47bc08db305f088f%7C64c12663ddf34823aa6836a6247905ab%7C1%7C0%7C638156956979881704%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9J97nMu85G0oouZ0l9gF6U0HFHTm%2FPlRDBSZvHg2bAE%3D&reserved=0).\n\n\n\nFDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency. This agreement covers such topics as the following:\n\n\n\n-  Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment;\n\n-  Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions;\n\n-  Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship;\n\n-  The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA;\n\n-  ORISE fellow's obligation to protect and not to further disclose or use non-public information.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: NSF 23-564  \n**Synopsis**  \n\n\n\nSynthesis Centers are a mechanism used by NSF's Directorate for Biological Science (BIO) to bring together communities that leverage existing data to catalyze discoveries through synthesis, analysis, and integrative training. Research supported by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) in BIO focuses on organisms as integrated units of biological organization, i.e., why they are structured as they are and function as they do.\n\n\n\nIOS seeks to establish a new Synthesis Center to advance our ability to explain and predict organismal resiliency and plasticity in response to complex and dynamic environmental circumstances encountered over a lifespan through the synthesis of varied data sets and types that bridge multiple scales and levels.\n\n\n\nThe Synthesis Center will enable innovative synthesis and analysis of available biological and related data by providing the vision, infrastructure, and expertise to advance new avenues of inquiry in organismal biology focused on organismal resilience and plasticity. To accomplish this vision, the Synthesis Center will adopt approaches that are based on open science, team science, and data-intensive methods that enable data synthesis, sharing and inclusive collaborations among researchers across multiple levels of biological inquiry that may include genomic, physiological, structural, developmental, behavioral, neural, immunological, and microbiological analyses across some or all the IOS subdisciplines. In addition to supporting data and knowledge synthesis, the Synthesis Center should train new generations of researchers in solving challenging research problems through data-intensive, open, cross-disciplinary, and collaborative science. The Synthesis Center is also expected to serve as an example in effectively engaging diverse scientists from different types of institutions and across multiple disciplines. These types of data syntheses are expected to provide the basis for fundamental scientific discoveries and/or potentially translational, use-inspired research. In doing so, the Synthesis Center will have a profound impact on the progress of science and society.\"",

        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number:   \n**Important Information And Revision Notes**  \n\n\n\n1.  This solicitation is for ITEST Resource Center proposals only.\n\n2.  Full proposals involving multiple organizations may be submitted as separately submitted collaborative proposals, or as a single proposal from the lead organization with other collaborating organizations included as subawardees.\n\n3.  The project description may be up to 20 pages.\n\n4.  One award will be made as a cooperative agreement.\n\n\n\nAny proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the *NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide* (PAPPG) that is in effect for the relevant due date to which the proposal is being submitted. The NSF PAPPG is regularly revised and it is the responsibility of the proposer to ensure that the proposal meets the requirements specified in this solicitation and the applicable version of the PAPPG. Submitting a proposal prior to a specified deadline does not negate this requirement.\n\n\n\n**Synopsis**  \n\n\n\nThe Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program is an applied research and development program that seeks to actualize a diverse future STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and ICT (information and communication technologies) workforce that is prepared to meet pressing local, societal, and global challenges. Because STEM and ICT careers increasingly rely on technologies and computing, the ITEST program funds projects that engage youth, from pre-kindergarten through high school, and pre-K-12 educators in equitable, innovative technology learning and education experiences within and across STEM disciplines in formal or informal settings. These projects build youths' interest and knowledge in STEM careers, and they prioritize the full inclusion of all groups to include those that have been underrepresented, underserved, or excluded from STEM educational opportunities. This ensures that NSF is better postured to leverage the full spectrum of diverse talent across the country.\n\n\n\nThis solicitation calls for a Resource Center for the ITEST program. The Resource Center will support diverse, multi-sector stakeholders in actualizing the three pillars of ITEST: (1) strategies for equity in STEM education, (2) partnerships for career and workforce preparation, and (3) innovative use of technologies in teaching and learning. It is expected that this Resource Center will facilitate individual and collective dialogue, reflection, and action relative to these pillars, while supporting stakeholders in the conceptualization, actualization, and communication of ITEST projects.\n\n\n\n**Program Description**\n\n\n\nThis solicitation calls for an ITEST Resource Center that is visionary in actualizing equity in STEM learning environments that inspire and prepare youth to pursue careers in the STEM workforce of the future. The Resource Center leadership team will facilitate dialogue across stakeholders as it actively elicits new perspectives on potentially transformative approaches to workforce development among communities and organizations that have been overlooked or under-consulted in this work. This team should reflect a commitment to equity and should include thought leaders with demonstrated expertise, experience, and research regarding equity in STEM learning and teaching.\n\n\n\nThe ITEST Resource Center will engage individuals and organizations who seek to expand their capacity to design, carry out, and communicate research on equitable, innovative technology experiences for all pre-k through 12th grade learners and their teachers, which will prepare the next generation of the STEM workforce to meet global and societal challenges of the future. These audiences include but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n1.  Current **ITEST Principal Investigators (PIs) and project partners** on ITEST-funded awards.\n\n2.  **Prospective ITEST PIs and project partners** who seek to develop competitive ITEST proposals and enact their projects through equitable partnerships and practices. Prospective PIs include those who are currently unaware of the ITEST program, but whose perspectives on STEM teaching and learning have the potential to transform the STEM workforce of the future and preparation for this workforce.\n\n3.  **Other innovators who seek to use equity- and evidence-based approaches to innovative technology experiences**, such as educators in formal and informal settings; community-based organizations; professional networks and organizations; industry stakeholders; policymakers; and STEM educational research communities.\n\n\n\nThe Resource Center for the ITEST program is invited to envision, design, and develop innovative and promising approaches to providing the following four functions:\n\n\n\n1.  **Cultivate a nationwide, multi-sector community dedicated to promoting equity in STEM education among pre-K-12 youth, and their educators, in ways that inspire and prepare youth to pursue future career opportunities in STEM.**\n\n    1.  Strengthen networking, partnerships, and synergies among organizations, institutions, networks, and/or industries with distinct strengths, resources, and areas of expertise. These networks should strengthen capacity of the field to deliver equitable, innovative technology experiences that prepare the future STEM workforce.\n\n    2.  Strengthen community-building and capacity among STEM educational researchers and practitioners, and their partners, to drive change relative to STEM education that prepares youth for future STEM careers.\n\n    3.  Enlist the interest and support of stakeholders and decision-makers, including industries, creators of educational technologies and media, policymakers, administrators, educational researchers, educators in formal and informal settings, and other sectors to amplify the impact of efforts to advance equity through innovative technology experiences for youth in formal and informal settings.\n\n2.  **Raise the visibility and impact of equity-based research and practice in STEM education, which has the demonstrated potential to foster a diverse STEM workforce of the future.**\n\n    1.  Develop and promote compelling communications about equity-based educational approaches that increase youths' interest in, and preparation for, STEM careers of the future.\n\n    2.  Provide ITEST recipients (PIs and project partners) with opportunities to highlight their work to a broad range of stakeholders.\n\n    3.  Synthesize and disseminate ITEST projects' findings nationally to inform and influence stakeholders. This includes conducting comprehensive analyses of the ITEST portfolio for internal and external stakeholders annually and as needed. It also includes enacting a comprehensive dissemination plan to communicate ITEST outcomes and resources to formal and informal STEM education professional organizations, policymakers, industry stakeholders, and STEM educational researchers.\n\n3.  **Support ITEST PIs, prospective PIs, and partners in designing and researching STEM learning environments that contribute to equitable or expansive workforce preparation efforts and outcomes.**\n\n    1.  Provide ITEST recipients (PIs and project partners) with opportunities to deepen connections across projects and to participate in continuous learning, reflection, and action, with a specific focus on equitable educational practices that have the potential to transform the STEM workforce of the future.\n\n    2.  Provide assistance relative to the design and enactment of equitable research and evaluation methods that will build the collective evidence base relative to equitable STEM learning environments.\n\n    3.  Provide technical assistance to prospective ITEST PIs and prospective partners, with emphases on developing competitive proposals that enact equity in their preparation and project design. The Resource Center should envision and enact a plan to provide technical assistance in proposal development to organizations that are currently under-served by the ITEST program, including those in EPSCoR states and rural areas, through regional workshops and other formats. Under-served organizations also include cultural institutions, community colleges, and Minority-Serving Institutions (as listed and defined by the US Department of Education list of MSIs: [https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-minorityinst.html)), among others.\n\n4.  **Promote equitable practices that support the ITEST program.**\n\n    1.  Provide visibility and support for the ITEST program, its funding calls, and other NSF funding opportunities and policies relevant to the ITEST program. The Resource Center will provide enhanced supports for groups, communities, and organizations that seek greater participation in vision-setting around the STEM workforce of the future, and the educational opportunities in pre-K through 12th grade that can help to make this workforce a reality.\n\n    2.  Broaden participation in the ITEST PI community, such that it includes more people from diverse geographic regions, organizations, and communities. This includes those that are underrepresented or not-yet-represented in the ITEST portfolio. This postures NSF to leverage the full spectrum of diverse talent across society\n\n    3.  Host biennial ITEST Awardee Meetings to share emerging findings and challenges with respect to equitable research and practice relative to innovative technology experiences for youth. The meetings will be organized in collaboration with NSF.\n\n    4.  Host webinars and in-person workshops that support organizations and individuals in dialogue, reflection, and action relative to strategies for equity in STEM education, partnerships for career and workforce preparation, and innovative use of technologies in teaching and learning.\n\n\n\nIt is requested that one of the mechanisms to fulfill these functions should be a virtual infrastructure, which may include elements such as a website, a digital resource repository, social media, and/or other means to connect stakeholders to resources, the ITEST program, and one another. Outside of this request, the ITEST program has intentionally left unspecified the mechanisms for fulfilling these functions in order to encourage creative approaches driven by proposers.\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\n***Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.**\n\n\n\n**USFS Office/Lab and Location:** A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) within the International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the U.S. Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency's mission and motivates their work across the agency. It's been there from the agency's very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the U.S. Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\n\n\nThe IITF is headquartered in Ri o Piedras, Puerto Rico, and its mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change. Current research focus includes disturbance ecology, climate change, forest ecosystem services, urban ecology, and forest policy and governance. \n\n\n\n**Research Project:** The project proposes to address gaps in knowledge of Caribbean tree species distribution focusing on assessing patterns of species richness, diversity, turnover, and endemism. The project approaches will include species distribution models and integration of spatially explicit environmental variables including climate, hurricane disturbance, and land-use, among other global and Caribbean region drivers. The project goals are to support conservation assessments and management actions with a focus on endemic tree species in the Caribbean region. The project fellow would conduct research and analyses on Caribbean tree species dynamics in landscapes prone to hurricanes using data from permanent forest plots located in various forest types in Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, US Virgin Islands, and other Caribbean forests. The increasing incidence and strength of hurricanes and droughts, combined with land cover changes, sea-level rise, and forest fragmentation are changing the landscape of Caribbean forests, and thus create the need to assess the distributions and conservation status tree species as important elements of biodiversity, cultural heritage, and other ecosystem services. This project will focus on leveraging data from permanent forest plot datasets in the Caribbean to build a comprehensive view of tropical tree species in support of conservation and broader management actions.\n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives:** The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to become acquainted with processes for documenting, organizing, and integrating permanent forest plot data sets, herbaria data sets, and querying taxonomic repositories using readable and reproducible programming. The project will also provide opportunities to learn about forest ecology, tree species composition, and hurricane disturbance dynamics in Caribbean forests. \n\n\n\nThe postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to present analyses and map visualizations outputs in workshops, seminars, reports, and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. The fellow will have ample opportunities to share communications of outputs in various platforms that are expected to serve to inform knowledge of local and regional plant taxonomy, species population sizes, and species abundance distributions for Caribbean tree species. \n\n\n\n**Mentor:** The mentor for this opportunity is Tamara Heartsill-Scalley ([tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov](mailto:tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov)). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2024.** Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USFS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full time.\n\n\n\n**Participant Stipend:** The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Current stipend for this twelve-month opportunity is $72,000 for a postdoctoral scientist, which is a stipend of $6,000.00 per month based on full-time participation. Health, medical and dental, insurance reimbursement up to $547 per month and a $3,000 travel allowance in support of research.\n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the [Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page](https://orise.orau.gov/immigration/) of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USFS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USFS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\n\n\n**Questions:** Please visit our [Program Website](https://orise.orau.gov/usfs/).

        "title": "\"Developing Regulated Therapeutic and Diagnostic Solutions for Patients Affected by Opioid and/or Stimulants use Disorders (OUD/StUD) (R41/R42 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-DA-24-038\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) proposing research projects, directed towards commercialization, for the development of novel, evidence-based, FDA-regulated medical products addressing the needs of patients suffering from opioid use disorders (OUD) and/or stimulant use disorders (StUD). Applications received under this NOFO may fall within two scientific areas, namely: (1) pharmacotherapeutics (small molecules and biologics) and (2) medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, including software as a medical device. This NOFO strives to contribute to the effort against the national opioid and psychostimulant emergency and offer new medical products for individuals, families, and communities affected by this devastating crisis. Small business companies that developed currently marketed technologies or are developing technologies for different indications and are interested in demonstrating that their FDA-regulated product has a potential application in the OUD/StUD space are encouraged to apply.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 100,000 deaths from overdose were reported from April 2020 to April 2021 alone. Data shows an increase in overdoses due to natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids, predominantly fentanyl, and psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine or cocaine. In fact, in the year ending in April 2021, fentanyl was the leading cause of death for adults ages 18-45, more than car accidents, suicide, COVID, and cancer. The scope and complexity of the current drug crisis are staggering, and there is an urgent need for a comprehensive effort to offer new medical products to the affected individuals, families, and communities. Scientific advances and product development based on those scientific advances can provide solutions to help overcome the crisis. For example, medical products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including pharmacotherapeutics and medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, offer promising means to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients suffering from opioid use disorders (OUD) and stimulant use disorders (StUD).\n\n\n\nThere are currently five pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. FDA for treating OUD and mitigating opioid withdrawal symptoms: methadone, buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, naloxone, and lofexidine. While these effective medications exist, they are underutilized due, partly, to patient retention in treatment regimens, policy barriers that limit the prescription of medications approved for the treatment of OUD, and stigma around opioid agonist medications. Recent data from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2020) show that only a minimal percentage of patients affected by substance use disorders, including OUD/StUD, receive treatment. Moreover, given the diverse nature of OUD, patients may have limited responses to available medications, and additional options could benefit more patients. There are no FDA-approved medications for StUD, including cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, there are five medical devices intended for patients suffering from substance use disorders cleared by the FDA. The list includes percutaneous or transcutaneous nerve stimulation devices designed to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal in conjunction with standard medications. The FDA also approved \"software as medical device\" solutions, also known as digital therapeutics, intended to deliver behavioral therapy to SUD patients as an adjunct to clinician-supervised treatment. While these technologies offer essential solutions for patients affected by SUD, significant constraints still limit patients' access. Examples of such restrictions include a lack of FDA-cleared devices with specific indications for patients affected by StUD, a lack of devices intended as a stand-alone treatment, a lack of devices approved for use in patients under 18 years of age, and reduced adoption due to limited payor reimbursement. Additionally, existing FDA-cleared diagnostic devices for OUD/StUD are limited, and there are no wearable devices intended to monitor or diagnose OUD/StUD.\n\n\n\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) strives to contribute to the emergence of new solutions by seeking applications to conduct research and development activities for novel medical products which would address the needs of patients suffering from OUD/StUD. Investigators and developers of biomedical technologies that lead to the prevention, monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of OUD/StUD are highly encouraged to apply. Applications received under this NOFO may fall within two FDA-regulated technical/scientific areas: (1) pharmacotherapeutics (small molecules and biologics) and (2) medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, including software as a medical device. Small business companies that developed currently marketed technologies or are developing technologies for different indications and are interested in demonstrating that their FDA-regulated product has a potential application in the OUD/StUD space are especially encouraged to apply.\n\n\n\n**Area 1: OUD/StUD pharmacotherapeutics**\n\n\n\nProjects proposed under Area 1 may include, but are not limited to, developing the following categories of pharmacotherapeutics for OUD/StUD:\n\n\n\n-    Small or large molecule agents.\n\n-    Biologics, including antibodies and therapeutic vaccines.\n\n-    Natural products.\n\n-    Longer-acting formulations of existing addiction medications.\n\n-    Longer-acting formulations of agonists or antagonists, e.g., longer-lasting naloxone formulations and new medications.\n\n-    Advanced drug delivery systems.\n\n-    Development and characterization of biomarkers.\n\nPharmacotherapeutics modalities other than those listed above may also be considered.\n\n\n\nApplications may include the following activities and steps in the R&D process:\n\n\n\n-    Target identification or validation.\n\n-    Assay development, confirmation of hits, and hit-to-lead studies.\n\n-    Lead optimization of compound(s) or biologic(s).\n\n-    In vivo pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicology studies.\n\n-    In vivo preclinical efficacy studies.\n\n-    Formulation development studies.\n\n-    Process development to support clinical manufacturing (e.g., scale-up feasibility).\n\n-    Other activities leading to the selection of a development candidate.\n\nSpecific proposed objectives will vary among applications. Appropriate objectives in Area 1 include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following examples:\n\n\n\n-    Development of in vitro pharmacological assays that cover a broad range of targets, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, enzymes, and secondary messengers to identify lead compounds, define the mechanism of action, and identify off-target activities.\n\n-    Completion of in vivo preclinical efficacy studies.\n\n-    Demonstration of acceptable safety (e.g., toxicity in rodents and/or large animals).\n\n-    Manufacturing of acceptable clinical dosage form [e.g., meeting Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) quality].\n\n-    Clinical Proof of Concept (Phase I and/or Phase II clinical trials).\n\nApplicants should propose and conduct activities that will eventually lead to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, as well as clinical studies to support the filing of either a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biological License Application (BLA). Applications may include biomarkers that assess the probability of OUD/StUD or allow an assessment of the treatment trajectory in patients under treatment for OUD/StUD.\n\n\n\nRecently issued FDA guidance on OUD:  endpoints for demonstrating effectiveness of drugs for treatment guidance for industry  (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/opioid-use-disorder-endpoints-demonstrating-effectiveness-drugs-treatment-guidance-industry) is a valuable resource in guiding R&D activities. For OUD, the proposed drug product must have a clear advantage over existing competing products and a clearly defined path with the ultimate goal of commercialization. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to establish a Target Product Profile for the proposed products (https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20190907022334/https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/target-product-profile-strategic-development-process-tool).\n\n\n\n**Area 2: Medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, including software as a medical device**\n\n\n\nProjects proposed under Area 2 may include, but are not necessarily limited to, research and development of the following categories of medical devices:\n\n\n\n-    Imaging technologies for investigating brain function and enhancing the diagnosis of OUD/StUD.\n\n-    Devices that directly diagnose and reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms or increase retention in outpatient therapies.\n\n-    Therapeutic devices (e.g., neuromodulation) intended to improve OUD/StUD treatment outcomes and prevent a recurrence.\n\n-    Devices, including digital therapeutics, intended to identify and treat newborns exposed to opioids, stimulants, and other drugs, to improve both short- and long-term developmental outcomes; novel approaches to managing neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\n-    Devices intended for the treatment of pediatric patients (e.g., neonates, infants, adolescents) including use of extrapolation methods to treat pediatric patients following FDA's pediatric extrapolation guidance:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/leveraging-existing-clinical-data-extrapolation-pediatric-uses-medical-devices.\n\n-    Devices, including digital therapeutics, with treatment indications for pregnant persons suffering from OUD/StUD.\n\n-    In vitro diagnostic assays such as Point-of-Care analytical tools for blood, saliva, or urine (e.g., lab-on-a-chip biosensors that allow remote performance of chemical or biological assays outside a laboratory environment).\n\n-    Stand-alone or adjunctive digital therapeutics (e.g., Software as a Medical Device, Software in Medical Device) focused on behavioral health interventions to diagnose, treat, prevent, and mitigate OUD/StUD.\n\n-    Devices, including wearables and connected digital therapeutics at point-of-care, intended to detect, diagnose, and treat opioid-induced respiratory depression.\n\n-    Data science and cloud-based technologies empowered by artificial intelligence intended to collect, integrate, analyze, and visualize multimodal data related to the diagnosis/treatment of OUD/StUD, including disorder progression and risk of recurrence.\n\n-    Technologies that integrate sensors, wearables, and environmental and social factors to analyze behavior patterns, social interactions, ecological momentary assessment of triggers, and identifying stress responses to personalize just-in-time treatment interventions.\n\nFor projects in Area 2, applicants should propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of FDA premarket application for clearance/approval (e.g., 510(k) or De Novo application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application). Such activities include early engagement with the FDA Center of Devices and Radiological Health via the presubmission program to receive feedback on proposed intended use, preclinical testing, and study design protocols. Please see for reference the FDA Q-submission guidance:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\n\n\nAdditional specific proposed activities may include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\n\n\n\n-    Studies supporting an Investigational Device Exemption application, where applicable, for significant risk devices (see https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/investigational-device-exemption-ide/ide-application).\n\n-    Process development for manufacturing.\n\n-    Non-clinical safety studies (e.g., toxicology, biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety).\n\n-    Safety studies in animal models.\n\n-    Clinical trials.\n\n**Non-Responsive Activities**\n\n\n\nThe following activities will be considered non-responsive, and will not be reviewed:\n\n\n\n-    Applications solely focused on disorders other than OUD/StUD (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders), as defined in the DSM-5.\n\n-    Applications pursuing non-FDA-regulated products.\n\n-    Applications pursuing FDA-regulated medical products for pain as a sole focus without addressing OUD/StUD monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, overdose prevention, and/or reversal.\n\n**Words Matter**\n\n\n\nDrug addiction is a chronic but treatable disorder with well-understood genetic and social contributors. NIDA encourages preferred language that accurately describes addiction and substance use in all submitted materials without perpetuating stigma and bias. Research shows that using person-first language-such as \"person with a substance use disorder\" instead of \"substance abuser\" or \"addict\" can reduce negative associations and punitive attitudes among clinicians and researchers. Further, the term \"substance abuse\" has no clinical relevance, as it is no longer included in the DSM-5 terminology. Instead, NIDA encourages the use of \"addiction\" or \"substance use disorders\" or other specific terminology, such as \"opioid use disorders,\" \"cocaine use disorders,\" as included in the DSM-5. In addition to using person-first language, NIDA recommends avoiding the term \"substance abuse\" and its derivatives in favor of \"use,\" \"misuse,\" or \"use disorder(s)\" where appropriate. Similarly, \"abuse potential\" may be replaced with \"addiction liability.\"\n\n\n\nNIDA encourages using the term \"medications for opioid use disorder\" (MOUD) instead of \"medication-assisted treatment\" (MAT) or \"opioid substitution therapy\" (OST) when referring to medications prescribed for the treatment of OUD. The term MOUD appropriately frames these life-saving medications as effective, frontline treatments. In contrast, the term MAT implies that medication should have a supplemental or temporary role in treatment. OST reinforces the misconception that MOUD \"substitutes\" one drug for another instead of supporting recovery. The terminology shift to MOUD aligns with the way other psychiatric medications are understood (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) as critical tools central to a patient's treatment plan.\n\n\n\nThese small but powerful substitutions may help address stigma in patients and study participants, which research shows reduces willingness to seek and accept treatment, among other adverse health outcomes. For more information on preferred language in addiction care, visit NIDAMED: https://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-terms-to-use-avoid-when-talking-about-addiction.\n\n\n\n**The STTR program is a phased program.**\n\n\n\nAn overall objective of the STTR program is to increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally supported research and development.\n\n\n\nThe main objective in STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. In contrast, the STTR Phase II objective is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization.\n\n\n\nBeyond the scope of this NOFO, it is anticipated and encouraged that the outcomes of successful STTR projects will help attract strategic partners or investors to support the ultimate commercialization of the technology as a publicly available product or service.\n\n\n\nThis NOFO invites three types of applications:\n\n\n\nPhase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization before proceeding to Phase II.\n\n\n\nPhase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Therefore, NIDA evaluates that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I before deciding on Phase II support.\n\n\n\nFast Track. In an NIH STTR fast-track both Phase I and Phase II are submitted and reviewed as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should include a clear rationale of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed approach and technology in the OUD/StUD area; demonstrate a high probability of commercialization; include clear, appropriate, measurable, clinically meaningful milestones to be achieved before initiating Phase II; and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-STTR) from future commercialization partners. The objective of Phase II (as a part of Fast Track applications) is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I to advance technologies to potential commercialization. Projects proposed for Phase II are based on the results achieved in Phase I (or equivalent) and aim to demonstrate scientific and technical merit and commercial potential. Therefore, NIDA evaluates that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I and that proposed milestones are met before deciding on Phase II support.\n\n\n\nSmall businesses eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects supported with a Phase I STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.\n\n\n\n**First-time applicants may submit a Phase I or Fast-Track application.**\n\n\n\n**Special Considerations**\n\n\n\nNIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the [Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugabuse.gov%2Ffunding%2Fspecial-considerations-for-nida-funding&data=05%7C01%7Cyvonne.walker%40nih.gov%7C2b30605ae50740cd31fb08dad6eab2e5%7C14b77578977342d58507251ca2dc2b06%7C0%7C0%7C638058600752895551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RZWNDnsvUK%2BgiMQdFmQN7h9cG6ADsnh51v0XvRnqG6k%3D&reserved=0).

        "title": "\"The Metastasis Research Network (MetNet): MetNet Research Projects (U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-22-234  \n**Purpose**\n\n\n\nThrough this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits applications proposing research projects that use integrative systems-level approaches to address a defined gap in metastasis research. Such projects are expected to integrate with the NCI's Metastasis Research Network (MetNet) and complement its ongoing research.\n\n\n\nProposed projects should emphasize one of the central themes defined in the MetNet FOA ([RFA-CA-20-029](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ca-20-029.html)) such as dormancy, early dissemination, cellular and/or physical microenvironment crosstalk, or mechanisms of responses by metastatic cells to therapies.\n\n\n\nConsideration of a central theme within specific areas of research encouraged by this initiative includes, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  Early dissemination and crosstalk as they apply to metastasis from the cancer of the lungs, prostate, pancreas, liver, kidney, bladder, or ovary;\n\n-  Metastasis to sites such as the bone, lungs, or rare sites;\n\n-  Metastatic processes such as the establishment of, maintenance of, or emergence from dormancy; and\n\n-  Mechanisms of metastasis in cancers with rising mortality rates and those with high incidence in diverse populations are highly encouraged.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\n\n**The MetNet.** Launched in 2021, the MetNet consists of U54 Research Centers that support, using systems level approaches to elucidate and integrate a mechanistic understanding of the non-linear, dynamic processes in metastasis. Considering both chronological progression and biological scales, the overall goal of the MetNet is to advance our understanding of metastasis as a whole body, systems-level problem with the goal of developing a comprehensive and cohesive picture of the emergent processes involved. The MetNet is governed by the MetNet Steering Committee. The U01 Research Project awardees supported under this FOA will integrate into and be required to participate in all MetNet activities, including serving as Steering Committee members.\n\n\n\n**Complexity of Metastatic Dissemination.** Our understanding of the mechanisms associated with metastasis is complicated by the fact that some genetically distinct cancer cells can disseminate early, and, for some, before progression to clinically defined invasive stages of primary cancer. Dissemination occurs in the context of a multitude of complex reciprocal interactions among the tumors and their soluble and physical microenvironments that can promote dynamic crosstalk between multiple organ systems creating a systemic disease. Despite increased understanding of many of the individual steps in metastasis, less is known about how each step is influenced by or influences distant tissues and the whole organism. Dissemination can occur non-linearly, via multiple concurrent, partially overlapping routes that require the acquisition of cell-autonomous and microenvironment-mediated metastasis-promoting phenotypes. Because the molecular requirements are distinct for growth in different organs and environments, defining such phenotypes is challenging. However, the use of integrative approaches that incorporate the host micro- and macroenvironments, immune-mediated events, and crosstalk among the primary tumor, pre-metastatic, and metastatic sites can aid in shedding light on the complexity and dynamic nature of metastasis.\n\n\n\n**Understanding the Spectrum of the Metastatic Process and Dormancy.** In general, metastasis research has often focused on discrete elements of the metastatic process, such as the acquisition of an invasive and migratory phenotype with experimental systems mimicking intravasation and extravasation using advanced stage tumor models or accelerated metastasis models in murine systems. Improving physiologically relevant models that capture the entire metastatic process and further developing probes to track and monitor the *in vivo* dynamics of metastatic cell states would help facilitate understanding of the spectrum of metastasis. In patients with cancer, metastatic cells lie dormant or quiescent at the secondary site for weeks, months, or years, only to recoup proliferative ability and develop overt metastases that appear later in clinical progression and/or after primary treatment. The molecular, cellular, and tissue-level mechanisms that contribute to the early dissemination, dormancy, and eventual growth of detectable metastatic lesions are not well understood, and definitive *in vivo* measures of early metastasis and metastatic dormancy are needed to continue to propel the field to the next level.\n\n\n\n**Metastasis as a whole-body, systems-level challenge.** The cooperation between the entire system or organism and multiple cellular phenotypes leading to metastasis and supporting metastatic outgrowth makes metastasis research a whole-body, systems-level/physiology challenge. Therefore, undertaking metastasis research using dynamic, holistic systems-level approaches -taking an integrated perspective that considers the whole organism -could generate mechanistic models that encompass dynamic biological scales, and provide opportunities to derive a more comprehensive picture of metastasis.\n\n\n\n**Research Objectives**\n\n\n\nPotential applicants are encouraged to visit the MetNet Website ([The MetNet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/dcb/research-programs/metnet)) or NIH Reporter ([https://reporter.nih.gov/](https://reporter.nih.gov/)) to learn more about the research covered by the MetNet Centers. A diversity of approaches, cancers, and themes are of programmatic interest. Potential applicants are encouraged to contact NCI Program Staff before submission with questions regarding project goals and scope.\n\n\n\nTo promote integration with the MetNet Centers, projects should encompass one of the central themes defined in the MetNet FOA ([RFA-CA-20-029](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ca-20-029.html)). Moreover, specific areas of research encouraged by this initiative involve early dissemination and crosstalk as they apply to metastasis from organs such as lungs, prostate, pancreas, liver, kidney, bladder, or ovary; metastasis to sites such as the bone or lung or rare sites; and associated metastatic processes such as the establishment of, maintenance of, or emergence from dormancy. Investigations that explore mechanisms of metastasis in cancers with rising mortality rates and those that focus on disparate incidence and outcomes among patients from racially and ethnically diverse populations are highly encouraged.\n\n\n\nExamples of individual research project topics that could fill the gaps within the current MetNet portfolio and cooperate towards a systems-level understanding of metastasis include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-  Characterization of molecular and phenotypic signatures that define the dormant state in secondary organs or metastatic sites and/or how those molecules and phenotypes act in concert with the mechanisms underlying metastatic dormancy;\n\n-  Determination of cell intrinsic and/or microenvironmental factors that support the maintenance of a dormant state, dynamic phenotypic switching, and/or exit from metastatic dormancy;\n\n-  Determination of cell intrinsic and/or microenvironmental factors that define pre-metastatic niche conditioning or organ tropism;\n\n-  Examination of the role of stem-like or developmental cellular features that facilitate early disseminated tumor cells or emergence from the dormant state;\n\n-  Determination of the effect of standard-of-care or targeted therapies on promotion, maintenance, or emergence from a dormant state;\n\n-  Development of clinically relevant experimental models that concurrently address multiple dynamic and plastic steps in the metastatic process to organs such as the lung or bone;\n\n-  Studies that integrate metastasis with the macroenvironment;\n\n-  Development and application of novel tools to identify and track metastatic cells in vivo, including metastatic dormant cells, circulating tumor cells, or other micro- or macro- metastatic lesions to address mechanistic questions;\n\n-  Determination of cell intrinsic and/or microenvironmental factors that facilitate early dissemination of tumor cells including angiogenic, immunogenic, neurogenic, and other stromal cells and structural proteins from pancreas, lung, prostate, kidney, bladder, or ovary;\n\n-  Studies that advance and integrate an understanding of the role of signaling networks that mediate neural invasion to promote metastasis; and\n\n-  Determination of the mechanisms and impact of innervation across tissues and organs and how that influences dormancy and colonization.\n\n\n\n**Organization of Individual Research Projects and the MetNet**\n\n\n\n*MetNet Expertise:* The MetNet Centers involve transdisciplinary expertise that spans cancer biology, genetics, physical sciences, neurology, immunology, physiology, systems biology, and bioinformatics. To continue to promote collaborative opportunities and expertise sharing, this FOA encourages the use of the multi-PD/PI option, with a team having complementary expertise. A designated Resource and Data Sharing manager is required.\n\n\n\n*MetNet Organization*: The MetNet will consist of the originally funded U54 Research Centers and all U01 Research Projects that will be awarded through this FOA. These entities will be governed by the MetNet Steering Committee, comprised of contact PIs, patient advocates, and NCI Program Staff.\n\n\n\n*MetNet Pilot Projects*: To promote greater interactions across the Network and allow investigators to cross-test ideas, pursue intriguing observations or validate findings, MetNet Center and Research Project investigators are required to set aside funds in the out years for Pilot Projects. How Pilot Projects are structured and who may apply for such funds is at the discretion of the Center or Research Project leadership team. Such pilot projects are not required to be described in the application.\n\n\n\n*MetNet Patient Advocacy Community Engagement*: Although not required for the MetNet Research Projects, the MetNet encourages the participation and support of patient advocates on research project activities when possible, including but not limited to, participation in research meetings, annual meetings, and engaging with research scholars to enhance their science communication. To learn more please visit: [NCI Research Advocacy](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/oar/research-advocacy).\n\n\n\n**Resources Relevant to MetNet Research Projects**\n\n\n\nMetNet Research Project awardees will have the opportunity to take advantage of Network-wide working groups and will be expected to participate in Network-related activities with the MetNet community. Some of these activities will be facilitated through the NCI's Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) Multi-Consortia Coordinating Center.\n\n\n\n**Non-Responsive Projects**\n\n\n\nThe following types of projects would be considered non-responsive for the FOA, and applications meeting these criteria will not be reviewed:\n\n\n\n-  Projects that do not emphasis cancer metastasis;\n\n-  Projects that propose population-level epidemiology studies or clinical trials;\n\n-  Projects that duplicate on-going studies within the MetNet;\n\n-  Projects that emphasize developing therapies to treat metastases;\n\n-  Projects that do not apply systems-level approaches to a metastasis question; and\n\n-  Applications that propose multiple large projects or describe specific pilot projects.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

Their compassionate gift giving was always made for public benefit.  Neither Bill nor Katherine ever sought any public recognition.  Their contributions supported the continued development of humanitarian programs, food and clothing for disaster relief, growth of the fine arts, advancement in medical research and innovation in educational programming. \n\n\n\nIt was after the passing of her husband that Katherine decided, in 1983, to establish the Snee-Reinhardt Foundation in order to continue the legacy they started together.  In 1988, with the intent to expand its grant giving capacity, the Foundation Bylaws were reviewed, revised and approved.  Renamed to the Snee-Reinhardt Charitable Foundation, these modified Bylaws have allowed more latitude in supporting a larger diversity of grants from many organizations; all of which have an impact on the social issues that we face every day. \n\n\n\nEven though the Snee-Reinhardt Charitable Foundation encompasses many broad areas of concern, or categories, there is no one area deemed more important than the next. Nevertheless, the Foundation has found it beneficial underwriting grants that are tangible in nature or serve a higher number of individuals within the community and surrounding areas.  The Foundation continually aids organizations that are endlessly striving to serve the community in various ways such as improving social conditions, expanding education, and working to better the environment.\"",

        "title": "\"Short Courses to Promote the Broad and Rigorous Use of Common Fund Data (R25 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: RFA-RM-23-014  \nThe NIH Research Education Program (R25) supports research educational activities that complement other formal training programs in the mission areas of the NIH Institutes and Centers. \n\n\n\nThe overarching goal of this R25 program is to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, to pursue further studies or careers in research.\n\n\n\nThis NOFO will accomplish the overarching goal by supporting educational activities that promote the broad and rigorous use of Common Fund data. Educational activities should include the following components.\n\n\n\n-  **Courses for Skills Development:** Training should be provided through short courses to equip users to interact with and use two or more Common Fund datasets in rigorous biomedical research. Courses should cover technical (e.g., cloud computing, data management), scientific (e.g., biomedical significance, statistical power), and implementation-related (e.g., budgeting, teaming) aspects of interacting with Common Fund data. \n\n-  **Mentoring Activities:** Mentoring activities should reflect dedicated efforts at providing not only technical expertise, but advice, insight, and professional career skills to course participants who may be new to using cloud computing and Common Fund datasets in biomedical research. Activities should support the growth of a diverse multi-disciplinary community of Common Fund data users. Interactions should build relationships meant to outlast the period of award. \n\n\n\nThis initiative is funded through the NIH Common Fund, which supports cross-cutting programs that are expected to have exceptionally high impact. All Common Fund initiatives invite investigators to develop bold, innovative, and often risky approaches to address problems that may seem intractable or to seize new opportunities that offer the potential for rapid progress. This R25 program is an initiative within the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), which is an infrastructure investment made by the Common Fund to address the growing challenges facing scientific programs that leverage data-intensive strategies. To support these programs and downstream data users, the CFDE is helping to ensure that all Common Fund data sets are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), providing training for users to operate on the data in a cloud environment, and ensuring that Common Fund data continue to be available after individual programs are completed.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nSince its initial inception as the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical Research, the NIH Common Fund ([https://commonfund.nih.gov/](https://commonfund.nih.gov/)) has supported many transformative research programs that generate new technologies, methods, and data. Many of these programs generate rich public data sets containing various multi-dimensional molecular and phenotypic data from several organisms including mice and human. This CFDE Research Education Program (R25) aims to maximize the impact of these data and engage a broader community of end-users for wider adoption of Common Fund data sets. These programs will provide short courses on how to access, integrate, and interpret two or more Common Fund data sets in rigorous biomedical research designs, and mentoring activities to support the career development and retention of course participants as long-term Common Fund data users. Mentoring activities are expected to foster a bi-directional relationship during the program between the mentor and mentee that serves the personal and professional growth of the mentee. All programs are expected to promote inclusive educational and research environments in which all members are respected and empowered to participate, and resources and opportunities are equitably provided. The CFDE encourages activities that have the potential to positively impact individuals from diverse backgrounds, including individuals from underrepresented groups, (see [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html)), and teach research methods that prioritize rigor and transparency ([https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm)). Best practices for diversity and inclusion in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and research by and for federal agencies can be found at [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091621-Best-Practices-for-Diversity-Inclusion-in-STEM.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091621-Best-Practices-for-Diversity-Inclusion-in-STEM.pdf). \n\n\n\nProgram Considerations\n\n\n\n*Program Structure:* Years 1-2 of the program should be dedicated to the development of program components (i.e., course syllabus, mentoring activities, evaluation metrics), and recruitment of a diverse cohort of prospective participants,including prospective candidates from underrepresented groups. The short course should be conducted before the end of Year 2 and evaluated according to the planned metrics. Year 3 of the program should be dedicated to making improvements to the training and mentoring activities and evaluation plan based on the outcomes of the Year 2 course. Before the end of Year 3, a second short course should be conducted based on the planned improvements and evaluated according to the planned metrics. Mentoring activities must occur during each short course and may additionally occur outside the period of the short courses, but within the period of award, as needed.\n\n\n\n*Course Format:* The Year 2 course is expected to be in-person and approximately 1-2 weeks in duration, as needed to fulfill the planned objectives. Based on the in-person experience from the Year 2 course, programs may choose another format (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous online, Massive Online Open Courses [MOOC]) for the Year 3 course if applicable. Changing course formats from Year 2 to Year 3 may require alternate strategies for the course, participant recruitment, and course evaluation. The Year 3 course should be approximately 1-2 weeks in duration. Actual course attendance must be at least 85% of the planned enrollment size. A certificate of completion must be presented to each participant at the end of each course.\n\n\n\n*Training Topics:* At the end of the training, participants should be able to analyze large complex datasets containing multiple data types, including but not limited to \"omics\" (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, spatial omics) and imaging. Topics may need to address data science, data resource management, data analytics, cloud computing, computational biology, study design, modeling, and simulation, including artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), depending on the focus of the course and the intended participant base. In addition, courses should cover implementation-related aspects of using and analyzing large datasets, including budgeting appropriately and developing relevant multi-disciplinary teams. At the completion of the short course, participants should be adept enough to begin bioinformatics research outside the classroom.\n\n\n\n*Public access:* The CFDE includes a portal or central access point for Common Fund data sets, tools, and other digital objects. All R25 programs are expected to share any outputs via the CFDE portal's dedicated training page for future and remote access. In addition to the CFDE portal, data may be shared through other web postings (e.g., public GitHub links), presentations at scientific meetings, and workshops.\n\n\n\n*Budgeting:* Program budgets must accommodate funds for the travel and lodging of: (1) one expert from each Common Fund program whose data sets are being used as course material to attend the course (if the experts are not from the applicant institution); and (2) the PI to attend the spring CFDE Meeting annually.\n\n\n\n*Data Sets*: The established Common Fund data sets listed below are well-poised to be incorporated into R25 programs. Applicants must propose using two or more Common Fund program data sets from the following list, and they are encouraged to propose using other data sets (including additional NIH Common Fund data sets not listed, other NIH data sets, and non-NIH data sets that are publicly available or will be made publicly available during the year of the award).

        "title": "\"Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Intervention Research (R01 Clinical Trial Required)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-21-307  \nBackground\n\n\n\nThe [NIA AD/ADRD Research Implementation Milestones](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones) highlight the need for \"novel and innovative dissemination and implementation methods to scale up promising practices in dementia care across settings and across disease severity spectrum\" (Milestone 13.H). A recent evidence review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ([AHRQ)](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/care-interventions-pwd/report) on \"[Care Interventions for People Living With Dementia and Their Caregivers](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/cer-231-dementia-interventions-final.pdf)\" underscored the need for rigorous, well-powered, replicable research addressing issues of intervention fidelity, efficacy, and potential intervention mechanisms, prior to dissemination and implementation on a wide scale. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is intended to address challenges highlighted in this evidence review by calling for activities that can lay the groundwork for principle-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) care and caregiving interventions that can be delivered with fidelity in the real world. The activities called for in this FOA are designed to facilitate the success of these trials by providing additional stepping stones toward ultimate implementation.\n\n\n\nInterventions are described by their essential components, the level of training required, and fidelity. \"Simple interventions\" are defined in this FOA as single-component interventions that can be administered easily with high fidelity, with minimal or no training required to ensure fidelity (e.g., \"nudge\" trials, \"default\" trials, pre-determined text messages etc.). \"Complex interventions\" are defined in this FOA as single- or multi-component interventions that require training to administer with high fidelity (e.g., interventions administered by clinical personnel, such as palliative care interventions, or interventions to cope with a dementia diagnosis).\n\n\n\nMillions of people in the U.S. are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), and this number is increasing. The extensive care needs of individuals with AD/ADRD are variable, and care typically involves great demands on spouses and other family members. Because care also requires coordination with a wide range of community and healthcare providers, it is often associated with high out-of-pocket costs. While many studies have been developed to improve care or support care providers, many factors contribute to the creation of barriers between efficacy and implementation, and few interventions have been implemented at scale. Some of these are systematic barriers that impede implementation and dissemination generally. In addition, some impediments to implementation are specific to the intervention itself, such as deficiencies in (1) knowledge of the underlying mechanism(s) or critical components of the intervention or the implementation strategy for disseminating the intervention, and (2) methods to ensure fidelity of delivery of the intervention in the community, including scalable, tested and validated training materials, that are designed specifically for use by individuals in the community, to deliver complex interventions. This FOA solicits research to address these two major impediments to translation of AD/ADRD interventions into real world settings.\n\n\n\n****Intervention Principles:**** The first challenge relates to the lack of knowledge regarding \"how and why\" interventions work. An insufficient understanding of the underlying principles of interventions, or the mechanisms of action of the interventions, may impede implementation in several ways: 1) simplifying and streamlining an intervention while ensuring that it will retain its potency is not possible when the underlying principles of an intervention are unknown; 2) many interventions need to be modified for a specific population or setting, but modification may interfere with intervention potency if the \"active ingredients\" necessary for efficacy are inadvertently removed due to adaptation/modification; 3) flexible delivery of interventions is critical to implementation in the community, but interventions cannot be delivered with both flexibility and fidelity if the main underlying principles of an intervention cannot be explained to the person delivering the intervention.\n\n\n\nInterventions that are defined by their principles could facilitate implementation by enabling simplification of the intervention and by promoting an understanding of how and when an intervention can *or cannot* be adapted while still retaining its positive effects. This understanding of principles is required for a scientifically informed understanding of the boundaries in which an intervention can be delivered with flexibility while retaining fidelity, a necessity for successful translation from research to practice.\n\n\n\n****Training and Fidelity:**** The second challenge concerns the training and expertise of those who administer intervention trials. Complex interventions conducted in efficacy trials are typically administered by interventionists who are experts or trained by experts, often accompanied by intensive supervision and/or monitoring. Pragmatic clinical trials and real-world implementation realistically cannot involve expert trainers, intensive training, supervision and/or monitoring, but instead may need to rely on training materials provided directly to participants or community representatives. Very few AD/ADRD care and caregiver support interventions, however, include user-friendly, relatively low-cost training materials, geared specifically to the person in the community who will be learning and administering the intervention, and that have been tested and validated for ensuring adequate and sustained fidelity.\n\n\n\nThis PAR utilizes the NIH Stage Model as its conceptual framework and encourages causal hypothesis testing as described in the Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) experimental medicine approach, wherever appropriate.\n\n\n\n**The NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development:** The [NIH Stage Model](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development) has the goal of creating efficacious, ultimately implementable interventions defined by their principles. It offers a framework for describing where an intervention is in the developmental pipeline and specifies appropriate research activities within different Stages of intervention development. The model facilitates discussion of intervention development research by applicants, reviewers, and funders with a common language. An understanding of the mechanisms of action or the principles underlying an intervention is an inherent goal of the NIH Stage Model.\n\n\n\n**The NIH Common Fund's Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) Program/Experimental Medicine Approach:** The [SOBC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/behaviorchange) mechanism-focused, experimental medicine approach is a methodology that is compatible with the NIH Stage Model . It encourages clear *a priori* specification of the intended mechanistic target(s) of an intervention, and methods that test causal hypotheses about the degree to which an experimental manipulation or intervention engages those targets. Within the experimental medicine approach to behavior change, intervention targets may include mechanisms or processes at any level of analysis (e.g., environmental, social, contextual, interpersonal, behavioral, psychological, and/or neurobiological). The SOBC program established the expectation that behavior change interventions are designed to explicitly test hypotheses about mechanisms of action, and that they incorporate appropriate measures to enable such tests. This includes testing hypotheses about which components of an intervention are responsible for change in a target mechanism or process, as well as hypotheses about whether changes in that mechanism result in a change in the relevant outcome.\n\n\n\nThis approach, especially when timing is considered within the design (e.g., does the hypothesized mechanism change before the anticipated outcome, or after the anticipated outcome?) and the NIH Stage Model enable each intervention study to contribute to a cumulative science of behavior change, strengthening our understanding of the principles whereby efficacious care and caregiver interventions achieve their effects.\n\n\n\nResearch Designs\n\n\n\nThis FOA encourages applications that propose to *modify, adapt, and conduct a preliminary test* of efficacy and the principles of an existing AD/ADRD care and caregiver support intervention or an intervention *originally developed* *in a non-caregiver population that might be adapted* for use in the dementia care and caregiving context. Applicants are expected to articulate their research aims and define the Stage of intervention development proposed using the NIH Stage Model framework. Applicants are required to use an appropriate experimental design to test hypotheses that will identify the essential components of complex interventions, or that will elucidate the mechanism(s) by which an intervention exerts its effects. This FOA also encourages research to develop, test, and validate training materials to ensure fidelity to the principles of an intervention when it is delivered in the real world. The types of behavioral intervention development clinical trials of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n**(1) Mechanism-focused research seeking to develop** **dementia care and caregiver support interventions defined by their principles.** This FOA solicits research to generate, modify, adapt and test interventions while simultaneously testing their hypothesized mechanism of action. Appropriate studies include the following:\n\n\n\n-  Stage I mechanism-focused, adequately powered studies to leverage and incorporate Stage 0 (basic science) findings to *create and conduct a preliminary test* of a dementia care or caregiver support intervention for efficacy and for its principles.\n\n-  Stage I mechanism-focused, adequately powered studies to *modify/adapt,* in accordance with its principles, and *to conduct a preliminary test* of an intervention: \n\n    -  Adapt and test an evidence-based non-caregiving intervention to a dementia care/caregiving context or population;\n\n    -  Modify the form of an existing dementia care/caregiving intervention into a more scalable, streamlined, simplified, and more easily implementable form, and conduct a preliminary test;\n\n    -  Modify the form of an existing dementia care/caregiving intervention to improve potency, and conduct a preliminary test.\n\n-  Stage II or III studies testing efficacy using an adequately powered and appropriate experimental design (e.g., experimental medicine approach; factorial or partial factorial design; sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) approach, \"MOST,\" or Multiphase Optimization Strategy) to determine/confirm efficacy and mechanisms of action or essential ingredients.\n\n-  Stage IV studies that test effectiveness of interventions defined by their mechanisms/principles, using an adequately powered and appropriate experimental design. This may include Stage IV Rapid Pragmatic Trials. When Stage IV Rapid Pragmatic Trials are proposed, please note the following: \n\n    -  Simple interventions (e.g., \"nudge\" trials, \"default\" trials, pre-determined text messages, etc.): must replicate results.\n\n    -  Complex interventions: replication is encouraged but not required.\n\n-  Stage V studies aimed at determining the mechanisms of AD/ADRD care and caregiver support intervention implementation strategies.\n\n\n\nTwo of many possible examples of mechanistic hypotheses and the testing of these hypotheses are provided below for illustrative purposes. Applications proposing mechanisms-focused intervention development work would be designed to test such hypotheses:\n\n\n\n-  **Example 1:** Hypothesizing, based on basic science findings, that changing (increasing or decreasing) a specific target (e.g., a type of empathy such as emotional or cognitive empathy or compassion) will lead to decreased negative affect (e.g., depressive affect or anxiety) in caregivers, and testing whether an intervention designed to change this type of empathy does so (engages the target), and determining if these changes are causally related to the hypothesized changes in caregiver anxiety.\n\n-  **Example 2:** Hypothesizing, based on basic science findings, that a specific type of music (e.g., music that is known to be liked by the recipient; music of a certain type, like classical music; or music that was played at a critical period during brain development) when played in a specific way, engages a specific target (e.g., emotion, emotion regulation, specific types of memories, etc.) which will lead to the desired outcome (e.g., improved well-being, better emotion regulation, decreased anxiety, improved memory) in persons living with dementia; followed by testing whether a specially-designed music intervention causes the changes in the specified target, and, if so, if these changes are causally related to the hypothesized outcomes.\n\n\n\n**(2)** **Research that seeks to enhance fidelity and/or develop, test, and validate training materials to ensure fidelity to the principles of the interventions for those in the community who deliver the interventions**. Such projects may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  **Modifying an Intervention to Promote Fidelity**: Stage I and Stage III research, guided by the hypothesized mechanisms of change of an intervention, to modify and conduct an adequately-powered preliminary test of this modified intervention, with the goal of maximizing the \"real-world\" fidelity of delivery to the principles of the intervention while retaining the intervention's essential \"ingredients\" (e.g., simplification of the intervention, computerization of intervention modules while retaining intervention potency, etc.).\n\n-  **Training Procedure Development and Testing**: Within the NIH Stage Model, an efficacious intervention is considered incompletely developed until it can be delivered in the community with fidelity to its principles. Training procedures to ensure optimal fidelity may be developed and preliminarily tested within Stage I studies, and further tested within community-based Stage III trials. Such research is meant to be guided by a focus on determining the mechanisms/principles of an intervention to produce operationalized and validated training materials that result in fidelity to those mechanisms/principles. This FOA supports adequately powered Stage I or Stage III research to create, test, and validate user-friendly, easily deliverable interventions to train care providers in the community to deliver an intervention while maintaining fidelity to the principles of the intervention. Applications proposing to develop training materials for such interventions would aim to ensure that the delivery of the intervention remains true to its principles of action. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n    -  Modules to train community interventionists (e.g., caregivers, nursing assistants, nurses, occupational therapists, physicians) to deliver specific elements of a complex AD/ADRD care intervention with fidelity in nursing homes or assisted living settings.\n\n    -  Modules to train community interventionists to deliver an intervention with fidelity to a family care provider.\n\n    -  \"Gamified\" training materials that community interventionists enjoy, and that increase fidelity of delivery.\n\n    -  Training modules, methods, or procedures to improve memory for the essential ingredients/elements or principles underlying an intervention, increasing memory for training materials, and thus increasing fidelity of delivery.\n\n    -  Training materials for any intervention that requires training to ensure fidelity to the intervention's principles when administered in the community.\n\n\n\nSpecific Areas of Research Interest\n\n\n\nAD/ADRD care and caregiver support intervention research can be for ultimate implementation in the home, community, or formal care settings, such as primary care, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, nursing and rehabilitation centers, hospitals, adult day care, and specialized hospice settings. These interventions may target behavioral, psychological, interpersonal, social, or institutional processes and may be designed for use at the individual, family, dyad, group, community, or health systems level. AD/ADRD care and caregiver support interventions may be studied within Stages I, II, III, or IV. Implementation strategies for AD/ADRD care and caregiver support interventions may be studied within Stage V. Applications may propose intervention research for individuals or systems who are providing care for people at early-, mid-, or late-stage AD/ADRD. Applications that address the principles underlying the care needs and challenges for individuals from diverse racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds are strongly encouraged. Applications that involve interdisciplinary and translational expertise, as relevant (e.g., basic science expertise regarding questions about mechanisms; healthcare system expertise when designing interventions to be used in assisted living or nursing home settings) are strongly encouraged. Applications are expected to propose principle-driven intervention development research with an eye toward real-world implementation, involving stakeholders and community participants wherever appropriate. Applications are required to use an appropriate methodology (e.g., the experimental medicine approach) to identify the essential components of interventions, to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for an intervention's effects, or to demonstrate that intervention can be delivered with fidelity to the principles or mechanisms of action.\n\n\n\nDementia care and caregiver support interventions can focus on a variety of outcomes for the person living with dementia and/or their caregiver, including, but not limited to improvements in sleep, subjective well-being and quality of life, stress coping and stress management, decision-making, care planning, financial planning, adherence to health-promoting behaviors, memory, relationship quality, social engagement, management of behavioral symptoms of dementia, care coordination, care quality, and care delivery.\n\n\n\nIntervention approaches may be derived from a variety of fields, including from psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, behavioral medicine, health services research, communication science, psychiatry, and geriatric medicine. Digital/mHealth or other technology approaches may be harnessed. Interventions may be at the individual, interpersonal, or systemic level and can include such things as environmental modification, electronic health record (EHR) modification, care coordination modification, etc.\n\n\n\nExamples of individual, dyadic, or group level interventions for persons living with dementia and/or their care partners include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  Empathy/compassion-focused interventions to promote emotional well-being for care providers or recipients informed by and incorporating Stage 0 (basic) research on empathy and compassion.\n\n-  Music-based interventions informed by Stage 0 basic research on music, the brain, and human development to inform dosage, type, frequency, etc. of the intervention.\n\n-  Interpersonal interventions (e.g., dyadic caregiver/person with dementia, or interventions with caregivers, care recipients, and providers) leveraging and incorporating Stage 0 research on social, interpersonal, or affective processes.\n\n-  Memory-focused interventions, informed by basic or clinical research on cognition and/or memory, to serve as an adjunct to another health-promoting intervention (e.g., a medication adherence intervention, an intervention to treat insomnia, an intervention to minimize negative affect, etc.) to improve the potency of that intervention.\n\n-  Interventions designed to decrease depression or anxiety levels, adapted for caregivers from interventions designed to decrease anxiety in other populations that are based upon basic principles of behavior change (e.g., behavioral activation, principles of extinction, inhibitory learning, etc.)\n\n\n\nExamples of interventions at the organizational or institutional level in Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) settings, such as in-home health care, assisted living facilities, adult day cares, nursing homes, hospices, hospitals, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n-  Care coordination (within a health system or between a health system and a home or community-based system) interventions informed by and incorporating Stage 0 (basic) research on organizational and care team-level processes/mechanisms.\n\n-  Patient or provider decision supportive interventions (e.g., advance care planning, de-prescribing, referral to palliative care services) informed by and incorporating Stage 0 (basic) research on features of incentives, framing, choice architectures, organizational processes/mechanisms, etc.\n\n-  Organizational interventions to promote well-being and quality of life and reduce distress through environmental modification or modification of programs informed by and incorporating Stage 0 (basic) research on environmental affordances, systems processes, and/or processes that impact individual well-being.\n\n\n\nApplications Not Responsive to this FOA\n\n\n\nThe following types of applications will be considered nonresponsive and will not be reviewed. This includes applications that:\n\n\n\n-  Do not propose a clinical trial, identified as Stage I, II, III, IV, or V as the primary specific aim.\n\n-  Do not propose a hypothesized mechanism of action or hypothesized essential ingredients based upon quantitative data (hypotheses based solely upon qualitative data will not be reviewed).\n\n-  Do not address issues of power.\n\n-  For Stage IV rapid pragmatic trials only: do not identify as a simple or complex intervention.\n\n-  For Stage IV rapid pragmatic trials only: do not replicate results for simple interventions.\n\n-  For Stage IV and V trials: Do not address generalizability to diverse populations.\n\n\n\n**Design, Analysis, and Sample Size for Studies to Evaluate Group-Based Interventions:** Investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions.

This resource, the Clinical Research Operations Management System (CROMS), is a comprehensive data management system to support the business functions, management, and oversight responsibilities of NIA grants that support the conduct of clinical research with human subjects. It is the expectation by NIA that all successful applicants will interface, integrate, or adapt their information system(s) and processes to interact with existing and future components of the CROMS as necessary.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII.

Analyzing and summarizing the impacting factors which are contributing to the delay in availability of generic topical drug products would provide direction of the current trend and future directions in the approval of these products.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.\n\n\n\nCompletion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.\n\n\n\n**FDA Ethics Requirements**\n\n\n\nIf an ORISE Fellow, to include their spouse and minor children, reports what is identified as a Significantly Regulated Organization (SRO) or prohibited investment fund financial interest in any amount, or a relationship with an SRO, except for spousal employment with an SRO, and the individual will not voluntarily divest the financial interest or terminate the relationship, then the individual is not placed at FDA.

        "description": " ExtrapolationThe present call invites proposals for the second three-year funding period starting in early 2025. Both continuation projects as well as new project proposals are highly encouraged. Each proposal must operate at the interface of CE and ML and have at least two applicants with corresponding expertise. The projects shall consider at least one of six scientific challenges: #1 optimal decision making, #2 introducing / enforcing physical laws in ML models, #3 heterogeneity of data, #4 information and knowledge representation, #5 safety and trust in ML applications and #6 creativity. The projects will be organised in a matrix between the areas of CE and the ML tasks. Data, models and methods will be shared among all participants of the programme on an internal platform. The organisation matrix and further information can be found on the homepage of the Priority Programme (see below).\n\n\n\nThe projects are expected to open up new methods for CE, formulate new types of problems for ML and jointly generate advances for methods in both ML and CE. Since ML has been used within CE for several years and substantial progress was made within the SPP 2331, projects shall go well beyond this state of the art. Under the umbrella of the six scientific challenges, the collaborative projects shall have promise for progress in process synthesis (especially regarding feedstock transformation), process flexibility, material selection, generation of alternatives and uncovering hidden information. Projects should address at least one CE area and one ML area, and clearly state how it will achieve progress in at least one of the challenges #1 to #6. Projects investigating and comparing different methods from ML for the same field of the collaboration matrix are particularly encouraged. Similarly, projects are encouraged where outcomes are transferable between the CE areas. Projects focusing on the phenomena and unit operation level should illustrate their implications on the process level.  \n\n\n\nThe focus of the SPP 2331 projects shall be on the field of fluid processes with or without chemical reactions. Examples or products from other fields could be included in case the fluid process remains the focus. Reflecting the scientific challenges and needs of fluid processes, relatively broad CE methods are allowed, ranging from molecular modelling, thermodynamic calculations, reactor development and the prediction of fluid properties up to methods dedicated to operation, synthesis and design of whole processes (including control and optimisation, uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental design). Projects may be purely computational and/or have ML methods directly applied on experimental CE. Topics reaching beyond this scope may be included, provided they contain sufficient work on the methods above.\n\n\n\nTo exchange research ideas and plan potential collaborations for the second phase of the SPP 2331, we will organise an optional networking meeting. Applicants that have not participated in the first phase are particularly welcome to join. The meeting will include a poster session, for which we ask each project to prepare one poster about the research of the participating labs. We also encourage adding information about the planned project to the poster. Projects can be represented by PIs and/or scientific staff (e.g. doctoral researchers).\"",

        "title": "\"B.20 Heliophysics Tools and Methods\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: NNH24ZDA001N-HTM\n**Scope of Program**\n\nThe Heliophysics Tools and Methods (HTM) program encompasses the Python software tools and method needs throughout Heliophysics, including Solar, Heliospheric, Magnetosphere, and Ionosphere/Thermosphere/Mesosphere (ITM).\n\nAs part of a mission-oriented agency, the Tools and Methods program preferentially seeks to fund those efforts that directly impact NASA Heliophysics missions or interpretation of mission data. Projects involving data from other U.S. agencies or institutions that are judged to be highly beneficial to NASA Heliophysics (HP) research are included in the scope for this program, if not available in a suitable form from their host's institution.\n\nThe specific context of this call is provided by information on the Heliophysics Data page at https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/heliophysics-data.\n\nHTM is a component of the Heliophysics Research Program and proposers interested in this program element are encouraged to see the overview of the Heliophysics Research Program in B.1 the Heliophysics Research Program Overview for Heliophysics-specific requirements. Common default requirements for all ROSES proposals are found in the ROSES Summary of Solicitation and the NASA Proposer s Guide but those may be superseded by instructions in a program element like this one. The order of precedence is the following: ROSES Element B.20 (this document) takes precedence followed by B.1, followed by the ROSES Summary of Solicitation, and finally the Proposer s Guide.\n\nProposers should be familiar with all these resources.\n\n\n\n**Heliophysics Tools and Methods**\n\nThis call solicits proposals to advance the goal of a robust, vital, and cohesive Python environment for Heliophysics. Two types of HTM programs are solicited: new HTM efforts and HTM maintenance efforts.\n\n2.1  New Heliophysics Tools and Methods proposals\n\nTypes of projects to be proposed under this call may include but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-    Data readers/writers for standard formats (FITS, CDF, NetCDF)\n\n\n\n-    Analysis code, e.g., pySPEDAS or SolarSoft components; common research methods.\n\n\n\n-    Visualization: improvements on common packages, focused on our needs including graphics from line graphs to 2D and 3D representations of data and simulations.\n\n\n\n-    Large data and large simulation use; parallel implementations; data mining.\n\n\n\n-    Generic Python machine learning and artificial intelligence routines.\n\n\n\n-    Specific science tasks that require either wrappers of, e.g., SciPy and NumPy routines or novel code.\n\n\n\n-    Exposing software libraries written in other languages to Python integration by providing the required set of wrapper routines.\n\n2.2  Heliophysics Tools and Methods Maintenance proposals\n\nThis type of proposal is targeted at existing efforts within the Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) that have attracted a broad user base. Types of projects to be proposed under this call may include but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-    Converting the software to a newer version of the programming language\n\n\n\n-    Addressing bugs and issues\n\n\n\n-    Improving the package s alignment with current PyHc software standards\n\n\n\n-    Improving the package s alignment with the requirements in SPD-41a\n\n\n\n-    Significant documentation improvements, including installation instructions\n\n\n\n-    Merging capability of one or more smaller packages into a larger one\n\n\n\n-    Interoperability and usability improvements\n\n2.3  Background on Python in Heliophysics Community\n\nThe main goal of this program element is to maintain and contribute to the current Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) effort. Useful information about the current status of work in this area can be found in the overview paper by Burrell, et al. [Snakes on a Spaceship, 2018], and more recent information can be found on the PyHC web site. The vision statement for PyHC states:\n\n\"Facilitate scientific discovery by promoting the use and development of sustainable open-source Python software across the solar and space physics community; improving communication and collaboration between disciplines, developers, and users; establishing and maintaining development standards; and fostering interoperability and reproducibility.\"\n\nThe strategic goals for this group are:\n\n\n\n-    Coordinate development across projects to minimize duplication of effort and share lessons learned\n\n\n\n-    Promote best practices for software development, documentation, testing, and dissemination\n\n\n\n-    Increase community awareness of and participation in projects\n\n\n\n-    Promote scientific reproducibility and software sustainability\n\n\n\n-    Educate and support the Python user community in solar and space physics\n\n\n\n-    Foster an open-source Python software ecosystem for Heliophysics research and education\n\n\n\n-    Identify community needs for future development\n\n\n\n-    Identify and pursue opportunities for financial support\n\n\n\n-    Enable efficient interdisciplinary research\n\nThe philosophy of this call is that the best way to make progress is to work on real projects of scientific community interest, with the aim to make functional code and to incorporate it into the existing PyHC framework.\n\nThe HP community has been developing a wide variety of tools for data access, production, and analysis based on the high-level, general-purpose Python programming language. Early career researchers, especially, tend to come from backgrounds where Python is the norm and languages (platforms/IDEs) such as IDL and MatLab are seldom used. Many senior researchers are also finding that Python provides a very natural way to conduct analysis and data-processing tasks. Python has the advantage over some other currently popular languages in that it is open source, and thus provides no economic barriers for use. It is widely used, with a model for namespaces that encourages the development of packages of code centered on a particular task; this has led to the rapid development in recent years of many of the tools needed in HP research.\n\n2.4   Programmatic Considerations\n\n2.4.1  New HTM Proposals\n\nProposals must discuss the relationship of the proposed effort to the present, as well as anticipated, state of knowledge in the field, and its applicability to the relevant datasets in Heliophyscis, and to any related NASA community research efforts.\n\nProposers should not duplicate work already being undertaken. The PyHC website includes pointers to many of these efforts. Listed below are the past selections that supported the PyHC effort:\n\n\n\n-      2023 HTM Selections\n\n\n\n-      2022 HTM Selections\n\n\n\n-      2021 HDEE Selections\n\n\n\n-      2020 HDEE Selections\n\n\n\n-      2019 HDEE Selections\n\n\n\nNote that until 2021, this program element was solicited under HDEE, but from 2022 on it is solicited separately as this (HTM) program element.\n\nProposers should consider the currently-existing software within the PyHC community and whether the proposed work should integrate into an effort therein, or if it makes sense as a new stand-alone contribution. This should be a considered decision, as new efforts require more work to complete the code base, considering the PyHC standards it must meet, along with the need to quickly attain community adoption.\n\nIf an award is made, code that is produced must be released as open source through mechanisms to be agreed upon by the Python in Heliophysics Community (see PyHC and Section 2.3) and NASA.\n\n\n\n2.4.2. HTM Maintenance Proposals \n\nProposers are expected to provide proof of broad community usage, possibly by the number of missions or modeling outputs the software supports, the number of publications using or referencing the software, the number of software downloads, the number of contributors, or other such metrics.\n\n2.4.3 PyHC involvement \n\nIf funded for new efforts, proposers are requested to: a) present an initial overview of work at a PyHC bi-weekly telecon and present on final efforts at a next PyHC bi-annual meeting and b) submit a Pull Request (PR) to the PyHC GitHub for the software (including a self-evaluation on standards groupings). If funded to contribute to an existing project, or provide project maintenance, (a) is the only request.\n\n2.5  Heliophysics Data Policy Implementation \n\nConsistent with the Heliophysics Data Policy, all projects under this program must involve scientific input, and all software and processes should support scientific utility, as evidenced by the support and participation of scientists. As a complement to this, all efforts must show evidence of good software engineering practices, for example, the use of clear, documented, tested, efficient code that fully accounts for IT security issues.\n\nProposers to this call must agree to the PyHC Standards that include requirements to provide documentation, version control, testing, standard packaging, and other elements intended to optimize the utility of the results. In line with the recommendations of the National Academy of Science (NAS) Space Studies Board report, Open Source Software Policy Options for NASA Earth and Space Sciences, the results of projects under this call will be made publicly available as open source software as detailed by the PyHC Standards. Each group that receives an award from this call must work in collaboration with the whole PyHC group for the benefit of all. Awardees are expected to attend at least one of the PyHC group meetings (typically three days, to be budgeted in the proposal) and abide by group decisions. Proposals to this call must indicate explicitly the understanding of, and agreement with, the above points. Proposers should show an awareness of the wide variety of datasets now available, see Table B.20-1, below, for examples.\"",

Research AMP is a plug-and-publish toolset, interlinking Zotero, PressForward, and WordPress to facilitate interdisciplinary communication, research mapping, and dialogue among publics, policymakers, and researchers. \n\n\n\nCrises like the novel coronavirus outbreak and its accompanying \"infodemic\" have demonstrated the need to put credible, accessible, and comprehensive humanities and social sciences scholarship in the hands of both expert and lay audiences, and bring essential historical context and expert curation to contemporary issues of public concern. The SSRC's MediaWell platform, launched in 2019 with a focus on the effects of mis- and disinformation on democracies, is the first example of Research AMP in action. A second SSRC Research AMP site, Just Tech, launched in February.\n\n\n\nThe SSRC now seeks to offer the Research AMP platform to the broader research community by launching a grant competition to identify and support researchers who are focusing on questions, topics, or themes for which Research AMP can be a useful tool. This opportunity is intended to foster research agendas based in emerging communities of scholarly practice. Partnering with the SSRC, and the CDS, up to four researchers or research teams will develop content and infrastructure for Research AMP partner sites, public-facing platforms that will curate and translate scholarship for a broader public audience.\n\n\n\nWith the support of the Mellon Foundation, the SSRC will grant four awards of US$30,000 each to develop a platform for fostering innovative, interdisciplinary public scholarship. The partnership period is 12 months as of June 2022. Successful applicants will be given early access to the Research AMP suite prior to its free public release, and the SSRC will support the research groups' development of their platforms. Project funds are intended to support thematic content development (research reviews, pedagogical tools, historical contextual essays, and so forth), as well as the technical implementation of the new Research AMP partner site. The SSRC will also help teams publicize the findings, policy briefs, historical reviews, and key interventions stemming from their projects. \n\n\n\nPotential topic areas for Research AMP Partner Sites include:\n\n\n\n-    Inequality and social justice in the twenty-first century\n\n-    Childcare and domestic labor in the post-pandemic era\n\n-    Race, ethnicity, political participation, and inclusion\n\n-    Reimagining criminal justice systems and their alternatives\n\n-    Social mobility, geographic mobility ,and migration\n\n-    The human and social dimensions of climate change\n\n-    Gun violence\n\n-    Mortality, ritual, and remembrance during Covid-19\n\n-    Labor movements and the gig economy\n\n-    Political polarization and reconciliation\n\n-    Supply chains\n\nThese topic areas are purely illustrative and applicants are welcome to propose their own. Projects illuminating the experiences of historically marginalized people are especially encouraged, as are those that can constructively inform policy responses across communities and institutions.\"",

        "description": "\"**Description**\n***Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.**\n\n\n\nA research opportunity is currently available at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), located in College Park, Maryland.\n\n\n\nSalmonella spp. are one of the leading causes of human gastroenteritis worldwide and pose a serious health concern. Many varieties of produce have been associated with foodborne outbreaks caused by Salmonella. The wide spectrum of food commodities that Salmonella serovars associated with highlights the adaptability of this pathogen to a variety of different food growing and processing environments. Comparing to an improving understanding of host-pathogen interactions underlying the infection process, our current knowledge on Salmonella survival and persistence in food growing and processing environments is still limited. In vitro evidence showed that certain Salmonella serovars can survive and persist under different environment conditions. Several genomic and population-based studies also revealed that the distinction between Salmonella serovars in terms of adaptation is more complicated than just presence or absence of specific genes. With the rapid increasing of our Salmonella genome database, our knowledge of gene function has increasingly lagged, and hinders our understanding of the genetic basis of microbial phenotypes (survival and persistence in agriculture environment in this case). High-throughput functional studies are needed to identify niche-specific essential genes. Genomic characterization and identification of niche-specific essential genes would greatly improve our understanding of adaptations of Salmonella serovars to certain environment conditions.\n\n\n\nExperience in gene modification, including gene transfers and knockouts, knowledge with various DNA sequence analysis equipment and adjoining computational programs, as well as other data analysis software is preferred. The fellow will perform RNA sequencing and Transposon-Directed Insertion Site Sequencing (TraDIS), to identify genes and other elements that may confer survival advantages to foodborne and environmental Salmonella in high stress environments. The Participant will be able learn these approaches including the subsequent analyses.\n\n\n\nParticipants will have an opportunity to utilize their knowledge about genetics and molecular biology from their education to enhance their career path by having a hands-on learning experience that will enable them to acquire experience they may need for future endeavors.\n\n\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, the participant will be involved in the following learning activities:\n\n\n\n1\\. Application of Next Generation Sequencing technology and Bioinformatics tools to characterize foodborne pathogens.  \n\n2\\. Performing Transposon-Directed Insertion Site Sequencing (TraDIS) to identify genes essential to different environment conditions.  \n\n3\\. Utilization of RNA-SEQ using Illumina, Pacbio or Nanopore technology for analysis of microbial transcriptomes to determine functional phenotype of organisms being assayed.  \n\n4\\. Performing gene modifications in Salmonella to confirm identified gene/pathway functions.  \n\n5\\. Participating in presenting results of research at technical conferences and to grant review panels.  \n\n6\\. Writing publications to submit to peer reviewed journals.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date:** **Opened Until Filled; start date is flexible**\n\n\n\nThis program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the College Park, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.\n\n\n\nCompletion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.\n\n\n\nFDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency. This agreement covers such topics as the following:\n\n\n\n-  Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment\n\n-  Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions\n\n-  Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship\n\n-  The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA\n\n-  ORISE fellow's obligation to protect and not to further disclose or use non-public information\"",

This program takes a \"materials-first\" approach to improving stability and reproducibility of state-of-the-art quantum bits (qubits). MQC focuses on solid-state qubits, for use in gate-based quantum computing, built from semiconductor- and superconductor material systems. Of particular interest are Si-based gate defined quantum dots or Josephson junction-based quantum circuits . More specifically, the goal of the research to-be-funded under this FOA is to identify correlations between qubit performance metrics and material properties, where the main focus is on identifying material properties which can be characterized in a high throughput and precise manner. In addition, an equally important goal is to identify the underlying physical mechanisms giving rise to these correlations. These mechanisms shall be supported by detailed material characterization measurements as well as material micro-structure and device modeling efforts.\"",

The goal of the program is to provide competitive grants to Municipalities and to Non-Profit Organizations as defined in chapter 117 of Title 24 for capital costs associated with major maintenance, renovation, or for the development of facilities for the delivery of human services and health care or for the development of educational opportunities in Vermont communities.\n\n\n\nThis is a competitive grant program and not all grant applicants will receive funding nor will awarded grant applicants necessarily receive the full amount of funds requested. This program provides last gap funding for shovel-ready projects and does not support ongoing fundraising initiatives. It is the intent of the legislature that grant applicants applying for any of the BCG programs shall not apply for more than one grant as defined in Chapter 137 of Title 24 for the same project in the current calendar year, in any of the categories of the BCG programs. This does not prohibit organizations from requesting funding for a different project in an alternate location under any of the BCG programs.\n\n\n\nGrants will be awarded by the BCG selection committee on a competitive basis. The BCG committee gives priority consideration to grant applicants demonstrating they have strong community support through the success of local fundraising campaigns. The deadline to submit BCG applications is September 10th each year. If September 10th falls on a weekend, the deadline will be extended to the following Monday. You may email the completed BCG application and all corresponding documentation to [BGS.BuildingCommunitiesGrants@vermont.gov](BGS.BuildingCommunitiesGrants@vermont.gov) or you may mail one hard copy of the completed BCG application and all corresponding documentation to the address on the BCG application. If you mail the BCG application and all corresponding documentation, please do not staple, or use paperclips. BCG submission envelopes must be postmarked by the deadline date of September 10th.\n\n\n\nMeetings with the BCG committees will be scheduled in the fall around mid-October. When the dates have been scheduled, these dates will be posted to the BCG website. Because the volume of applications is so extensive, the BCG website will be updated the same day following the meeting with the BCG committee members. For awareness of awarded/non-awarded applications, all applicants should check the BCG website: [http://www.bgs.vermont.gov/commissioner/building-communities-grants.](http://www.bgs.vermont.gov/commissioner/building-communities-grants)\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free the Grant Administrator at our office at (802) 828-3519 or at [BGS.BuildingCommunitiesGrants@vermont.gov.](BGS.BuildingCommunitiesGrants@vermont.gov) For your convenience, we have made this and other grant application materials available online at the following location:\n\n[http://www.bgs.vermont.gov/commissioner/building-communities-grants.](http://www.bgs.vermont.gov/commissioner/building-communities-grants) Please check the BCG website for any new updates.\n\n\n\nWe look forward to working with everyone!\"",

        "description": "\"Scope of Program \nThe goal of the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis (ANGSA) Program is to maximize the science derived from samples returned by the Apollo Program in preparation for future lunar missions anticipated in the 2020s and beyond. To achieve this, the 2nd ANGSA call will focus on small, high-value samples that are nearing their pristinity limit.\n\n\n\n\"Pristine\" Apollo samples are those which have been in NASA custody continuously since return from the Moon. They are stored and handled in stainless steel glove cabinets that are purged by high-purity nitrogen gas to minimize degradation of the samples. Pristine samples have always been separated from human hands by three layers of gloves. As a general guideline, lunar sample allocations are not made such that the remaining sample falls below the so-called  pristinity limit  (less than 50% by weight of the original mass). This applies not only to individual samples, but also to rare types of clasts that may be found in breccias or soils. However, this opportunity is to perform high-impact science, using a consortium approach, that focuses on small, high-\n\nvalue samples nearing their pristinity limit and/or samples that are in high demand yet have low mass and/or are nearing their pristinity limit. Therefore, NASA will consider allocating samples that would result in the remaining pristine mass being less than 50% of the original pristine material, dependent on the scientific merit of the proposal.\n\n\n\nOnly proposals that focus on the analysis of the list of highlighted samples below (in Section 2.1) will be considered, although proposers are welcome to include other lunar samples in their studies to help understand these rare samples. All proposed work must be in support of the overarching priority science questions set forth in the Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023 -\n\n2032 (available at https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/planetary-science-and-\n\nastrobiology-decadal-survey-2023-2032).\"",

While the ecosystem forms a continuum across the Tanzanian border, the focus is the landscape within the Kenyan side.   TCA is a vast conservation landscape comprising 42,000 Km2 of  wilderness areas, including Tsavo East (13,747 km2), Tsavo West (9,065 km2), and Chyulu Hills (320 km2) National Parks (NP), which combined form 49 percent of  Kenya s National Parks. The area is a popular tourism destination connected to the coastal tourism circuit and one of  the most visited parts of the country. The landscape has the largest elephant population in Kenya (12,866 elephants, 2017 KWS census), which ranges through Tsavo s protected areas into adjacent lands outside the parks.\n\n\n\nThe Taita ranches comprise a critically important area in the TCA, serving as a wildlife corridor between Tsavo West and East NPs; thus, enabling trans ?boundary movement into Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania. These ranches have the potential to provide a b uf fer to the protected area complex through the proposed community conservation ef forts and provide an opportunity to deliver tangible wildlife?based benef its to communities.\n\n\n\nThe parks in Tsavo lack buf fer zones of  community conservancies and community s upport that comes with conservancies. There has been relatively little and inconsistent investment in the group ranches in the past, and there are few conservation players currently working in the landscape.

We are particularly interested in submissions that have a broad chronological range and/or interdisciplinary breadth, and that are tightly connected by a theme. Standard panels typically include three presenters speaking for 20 minutes each and a chair, while roundtables typically include four presenters speaking for 15 minutes each and a chair; commentators are optional, but if included, we recommend comments be kept to 5 minutes. We are open to other formats, so please feel free to consult with the program committee chair.\n\n\n\nTo secure as broad a range of participation, we will also consider individual paper proposals. Panels that include a diverse mix of presenters across fields and career stages are particularly encouraged. To foster intellectual interchange, we ask applicants to compose panels that feature participation from multiple institutions. In an effort to allow a broader range of participants, no participant will be permitted to take part in more than one session in a substantial role. (That is, someone presenting or commenting on one panel cannot also present or comment on another, though individuals presenting or commenting on one panel may serve as chairs for other panels, if need be.) Submissions are welcome from participants in last year's conference, though if the number of strong submissions exceeds the number of available spaces, selection decisions may take into account recent participation.\n\n\n\nAs complete panels are more likely to be accepted, we recommend that interested participants issue calls for participants on the [conference discussion forum](https://www.nacbs.org/forum/2024-nacbs-denver) on our webpage, as well as on social media. Please tag the relevant NACBS accounts if you wish for us to amplify your call for participants (NACBS maintains accounts on BlueSky, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). We also strongly encourage graduate students interested in more information about conference preparation, coordination, and participation to join the GECC email group [here](https://www.nacbs.org/grad-ecr-caucus). If a full panel cannot be arranged by the deadline, however, please do submit the individual proposal and the program committee will try to build submissions into full panels as appropriate.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the panels, we will be sponsoring a poster session.  The posters will be exhibited throughout the conference, and there will be a scheduled time when presenters will be with their posters to allow for further discussion. Individual paper submissions which do not fit into pre-submitted or newly created panels may be invited to present at the poster session.\"",

The Program regulations are in Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 84. Additional information about the NCWCG Program is available here. The NCWCG Program provides eligible State agencies with grants for projects that protect and restore valuable coastal wetland resources. Projects can include: Acquisition of a real property interest (e.g., conservation easement or fee title) in coastal lands or waters (coastal wetlands ecosystems) from willing sellers or partners for long term conservation; Restoration, enhancement, or management of coastal wetlands ecosystems; or A combination of acquisition, restoration, enhancement, and management. All projects must ensure long term conservation (at least 20 years) of coastal wetland resources. We score and rank applications based on criteria published in 50 CFR 84.32. See Section E. Application Review Information of this announcement for a summary of the ranking criteria. Projects to create wetlands where wetlands did not previously exist are ineligible for NCWCG Program funding (50 CFR 84.20(b)(3)). For each project site, we require evidence verifying the current or historic presence of a wetland. This may include information from the Service's National Wetlands Inventory, earlier Geographic Information System data, or historic information. Projects to acquire and/or restore upper portions of watersheds where benefits to the coastal wetlands ecosystem are not significant and direct are also ineligible for NCWCG Program funding (50 CFR 84.20(b)(8)). A proposal must include sufficient information demonstrating that targeted lands or waters meet the definition of a coastal wetland ecosystem (50 CFR 84.11). Wildlife TRACS (Tracking and Reporting Actions for the Conservation of Species) is the tracking and reporting system used by WSFR to capture information about conservation and related actions funded by its grant programs. TRACS serves as the electronic repository system for all performance, accomplishment, and real property reporting related to those Federal awards. TRACS highlights program accountability by documenting program accomplishments and results. As outlined in this announcement, grant and project statement information and performance reporting data must be entered into TRACS as authorized under 2 CFR 200.102(c), 200.202, 200.301, and 200.329.\"",

        "description": " Jr.This Funding Opportunity Announcement covers the following three grant programs available for funding:\n\n**A. William B. \"Bill\" Bankhead and David Coley Cancer Research Program**\n\nThe William B.  Bill  Bankhead, Jr., and David Coley Cancer Research Program (Bankhead Coley) is established in section 381.922, Florida Statutes. The Florida Legislature specified the purpose of the program is to advance progress toward cures for cancer through grants awarded through a peer-reviewed, competitive process.\n\nThe program shall provide grants for cancer research to further the search for cures for cancer, by pursuing the following goals:\n\n\n\n1. Significantly expand cancer research capacity in Florida.\n\n2. Improve both research and treatment through greater pediatric and adult participation in clinical trials networks.\n\n3. Reduce the impact of cancer on disproportionately impacted individuals.\n\n\n\n**2. Research Priorities**\n\n\n\nThe Biomedical Research Advisory Council (BRAC) advises the State Surgeon General as to the direction and scope of grant programs. The responsibilities of the council may include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n-      Providing advice on Program priorities and emphases.\n\n-      Developing criteria and standards for the award of research grants.\n\n\n\nThe priorities listed in this Funding Opportunity were developed by the BRAC based on the Strategic Goals and Tactics developed in 2014. Funding opportunity announcements may vary in areas of focus and in the types of funding mechanisms offered, but will be based on the Strategic Research Goals, available at:\n\nhttp://www.floridahealth.gov/provider-and-partner- resources/research/FINAL-BRAC-\n\nStrategic-Goals-and-Tactics.pdf.\n\n\n\nTo balance the number of grants awarded across Research Priorities, this year the Department will prioritize applications that address the following:\n\n1. Reduction of mortality and morbidity as related to disproportionately impacted individuals.\n\n2. Improve screening accuracy and detection in high-risk groups.\n\n3. Resistance to front-line treatments in recurrent disease in the five cancers listed.\n\n4. Research focused on sarcomas, or leukemia and other blood cancers.\n\n5. Prevention and treatment research evaluating programs for tobacco use reduction and prevention (James & Esther King)\n\n6. Prevention of the transition from electronic nicotine to combustible tobacco usage or demonstrates the effectiveness of the use of electronic nicotine in the reduction or elimination of the use of combustible tobacco. Priority applications include studies on basic biology of electronic cigarettes (James and Esther King)\n\n7. Examine the relationship between obesity and cancer, cancer treatment responsiveness, and cancer treatment-related morbidities. Applications related to other areas described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will be considered, but not at the same level of priority.\n\n \n\n**Research Infrastructure**\n\n\n\nEligible organizations may submit an infrastructure application in at least one of the following six areas: tissue banking, bioinformatics, genomics, diagnostic imaging, disproportionately impacted individuals, or quality indicator systems, as described on the following pages. The Florida Department of Health (Department) is particularly interested in research involving quality indicator systems, when this is linked with other priorities, such as increasing the number of Florida research networks, external funding for research infrastructure and large-scale projects, including but not limited to National Cancer Institute grants. Organizations will only be permitted to be the lead on one application but may be collaborators on applications submitted by other organizations. When organizations collaborate on more than one infrastructure application, they need to describe how the projects are different and do not overlap.\n\n\n\nThe expectation is that infrastructure improvements, where practical, will be made available to and used by researchers throughout Florida. Projects need to demonstrate institutional collaboration and statewide research networks in the pursuit of a research question or development of infrastructure. In addition, projects need to provide a quantitative method to evaluate the use of infrastructure resulting from this grant. For example, the investigator could measure the number of patients screened from a medical imaging device or the number of researchers external to the project who were provided with tissue samples.\n\n\n\nApplications must describe:\n\n\n\n-      A plan for providing access to the funded infrastructure.\n\n\n\n-      A scientific advisory process involving researchers from at least four universities and/or research institutions.\n\n\n\n-      A community advisory process that represents the perspective of participants in research, with focus on the perspectives of underserved and minority populations and communities that historically lack trust in research.\n\n\n\nApplications may include support to address ethical, legal, and social issues in the research.\n\n\n\nThe solicitation is limited to proposals that will improve infrastructure/resources in the areas of tissue banking, bioinformatics, genomics, diagnostic imaging, disproportionately impacted individuals, and quality indicators systems.\n\n \n\nTissue banking. The solicitation is for infrastructure/resources to expand procurement of tissue samples for research in cancer; expand the intake, storage, and analysis of specimens; and expand the distribution of samples for research. The solicitation seeks applications for infrastructure/resources required to create sustainable programs that increase the number of samples from healthy persons and from under-represented groups. The expectation is that funded projects will result in the procurement of a substantial number of samples by the end of the grant period, as well as a sustainable program for ongoing collection of samples from healthy people and under-represented groups. In addition to expanding procurement through outreach and recruiting, funds may be used to expand existing infrastructure and software for intake, storage, and analysis. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and timeframes for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure. Projects may include infrastructure and programs to improve dissemination and sharing of tissue samples. The expectation is that tissue samples will be shared with any university or research institution in Florida, and that there will be a significant increase in the sharing of samples by the end of a project.\n\nBioinformatics. The solicitation seeks applications to expand existing infrastructure/ resources for analysis of biomedical data, including genomic and proteomic information and the study of biological systems most relevant to cancer. Projects may include improving algorithms, databases, and modeling of biological phenomena; purchase of equipment, and software; and support for the expansion of cross-disciplinary research teams. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and timeframes for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure. Projects may include but are not limited to expanding the ability to analyze very large data sets; the identification of tissue-specific biomarkers brought on by cancer; or improvements in ways of automating clinical imaging.\n\n\n\nMedical imaging. The solicitation seeks to expand existing infrastructure that improves the quality, speed, and accuracy of medical imaging or develops processes that measure the effectiveness of imaging technologies. Projects may include but are not limited to improvements in screening for lung and breast cancer or research examining the correlation between the expanded use of imaging technologies and health outcomes. Projects may include improvements to software and equipment. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and time frames for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure.\n\n\n\nGenomics. The solicitation seeks to expand existing infrastructure in the areas of functional genomics, genomic biomarkers, epigenetics, next-generation sequencing, miRNA and non-\n\ncoding RNA, qPCR, proteomics and proteome analysis including chromatography or mass spectroscopy. Funds are intended to be used to upgrade software and equipment that will make organizations competitive for additional funding and serve as a national resource. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and time frames for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure.\n\n \n\nDisproportionately impacted individuals. In Florida there are significant differences in the morbidity and mortality of cancer depending on location, and other social determinants of health. Projects may include but are not limited to expanding access to core resources for researchers, development of clinical guidelines and education programs to improve the quality and consistency of screening and clinical care, or the development of coordinating centers for research on diseases with significant disproportionately impacted individuals. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and time frames for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure.\n\n\n\nQuality indicator systems. Adopting a continuous comprehensive quality indicator system is associated with improved cancer treatment outcomes. The solicitation seeks to support projects that create sustainable ongoing systems to collect quantitative data about: treatment outcomes and compare them with national outcomes or treatment processes and compare them with evidence-based standards, including consensus standards, or other practice standards such as emerging findings in the research literature. The expectation is that the organization will publish treatment outcomes at least annually in a prominent place on the organization's website and publish descriptions of how the organization is using the information obtained through the collection of quality indicators to improve care. The expectation is that projects will include sustainable ongoing mechanisms to improve sharing of infrastructure/resources with external researchers and research institutes in Florida. Projects should describe measurable targets and timeframes for expanding access as well as describe a process to evaluate improved outcomes related to this infrastructure.\"",

        "description": " Virtual Cancer Center Director Award\"The FY24 PRCRP VCCDA supports a unique, interactive virtual cancer center (VCC) focused on bringing together two established investigators and up to 12 newly awarded additional early career investigators (Scholars) and their mentors (Career Guides) to interrogate the commonalities of cancer. In addition, there are seven Scholars with active awards from FY22 who would join the VCC under the auspices of the FY24 VCCDA. The VCC will provide intensive mentoring, national networking, collaborative opportunities, and a peer group for Scholars.\n\n\n\nThe Director and Deputy Director (referred to as the VCC Leadership) will catalyze the growth and professional development of the Scholars, promote the cross pollination of different cancer disciplines, assess the progress of the Scholars, and facilitate communication and collaboration among all of the VCC members. The VCC will give the Scholars opportunities to operate in a collegial, highly dynamic, and cutting-edge center to lead cancer research to a new frontier.\n\n\n\n***This FY24 Funding Opportunity is soliciting applications for a Director and Deputy Director to design and implement the VCC.*** The Director and Deputy Director must be established cancer researchers, be at different institutions, and be in different cancer disciplines along the cancer care spectrum. The VCC Leadership must demonstrate a strong record of mentoring and training early career investigators, a commitment to leadership, and the ability to objectively assess the progress of all of the Scholars in the VCC. It is the intention that through the VCC, collaborations will foster new growth in different cancers and spur and integrated cancer center to ensure the research advancements across different cancer centers.\n\n\n\nThe Virtual Cancer Center Director Award is structured to support two Principal Investigators (PIs). The Director will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with application submission. The Deputy Director will be identified as the Partnering PI. Both PIs should contribute significantly to the development and execution of the VCC. If recommended for funding, each PI will be named on separate awards to the recipient organization(s). Each award will be subject to separate reporting, regulatory, and administrative requirements. For individual submission requirements for the Initiating and Partnering PI(s), refer to Section II.D.2, Content and Form of the Application Submission.\n\n\n\nThe application should clearly demonstrate that both PIs have equal levels of input on the proposed VCC Leadership and clearly define the components to be addressed by each to continue the success of Scholars. While it is up to the Director and Deputy Director to define their roles, both VCC Leaders should have interactions with the Scholars; acting as administrative support does not fulfill the intent of the Deputy Director.\n\n\n\nA portion of the total direct budget costs (no more than 15%) must be reserved to support the collaborative \"seed projects.\" Seed projects should be collaborative projects conceived and proposed by a minimum of two current Scholars. The VCC Leadership will be responsible for developing the intent of the seed projects, the submission requirements, and coordinating and funding a scientific peer review of projects proposed for funding during the period of performance.\n\n\n\nThe PRCRP seeks to promote novel approaches to ending cancer through convergent science cancer research. Convergent science as defined by the National Science Foundation ([https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp)) \"is a means of solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and forming novel frameworks to catalyze scientific discovery and innovation.\" Convergent science taps into a variety of disciplines to answer the issues in cancer (i.e., prevention, diagnosis/detection, treatment, quality of life, disparities) including but not limited to biomedical sciences, data science, engineering, psychology, and chemistry. Convergent science breaks down the barriers of cancer research and builds a whole answer with tools from different areas of expertise. Investigators applying to the VCCDA are encouraged, but not required, to integrate convergent science in the design of the VCC.\"",

        "description": "\"The Temple Bar Foundation was created in 1991 by the Right Honorable Lord Denning of Whitchurch**What is the Temple Bar?**\n\n\n\nThe Temple Bar is a great arched stone gate, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, which once stood as an entrance to central London. The area surrounding the Temple Bar was where guilds of lawyers organized into what would become the four English Inns of Court. This same area is now considered \"Legal London.\" The archway stood in place until 1878, when modern traffic forced its removal to the countryside. It is the last of the original gates to London to remain standing. The Temple Bar gate was returned to the City of London and opened to the public in November 2004. It now serves as an entrance to Paternoster Square just north of one of Wren's other great achievements, Saint Paul's Cathedral\n\n\n\n**About the Program** \n\nThe scholarship begins in late September, with scholars attending the ceremonial opening of the legal year at Westminster Abbey and a reception held in their honor, hosted by COMBAR at the Old Hall, Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn. During the first week, scholars visit the four Inns of Court and meet with preeminent leaders of the English bench and bar.\n\nThe following two weeks are spent in mini-pupillage in leading barristers chambers. While there, scholars \"shadow\" a barrister and observe and discuss English trial practice. The scholars receive intense exposure to the English legal system and learn first-hand from some of the most senior members of the legal profession.\n\nThe final week of the scholarship is spent with a justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Scholars observe the appellate process with opportunities to discuss matters with members of the United Kingdom s highest court.\"",

CDC works to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.\n\n\n\nCDC's Division of Population Health provides scientific leadership and expertise to prevent costly chronic diseases and improve health across the life span.\n\n\n\nPRTB provides leadership, oversight, and grant management for Prevention Research Centers (PRC) Program, the Closing the Gap: Social Determinant of Health (SDOH) Accelerator Grant Program, and CDC's Workplace Health Program.\n\n\n\nThe PRC Program provides leadership, oversight, and technical assistance to a network of 26 Prevention Research Centers (PRCs) who conduct innovative public health prevention research using a community engagement approach.\n\n\n\nThe CDC Workplace Health Program provides leadership to improve the health, safety, and well-being of employees through science-based workplace health promotion programs.\n\n\n\n**Research Project:** **Implementation science** is the scientific study of methods and strategies that facilitate the uptake of evidence-based practice and research into regular use by practitioners and policymakers. The field of implementation science seeks to systematically close the gap between what we *know* and what we *do* (often referred to as **the know-do gap** ) by identifying and addressing the barriers that slow or halt the uptake of proven health interventions and evidence-based practices. Implementation science differs from intervention research in that it focuses on the strategies used to implement evidence-based practices, rather than on intervention effectiveness.\n\n\n\n**Learning Objectives**: During this learning experience, the ORISE fellow will:\n\n\n\n-  Engage researchers from the PRCs and practitioners from State and Territorial Chronic Disease Units (CDUs).\n\n-  Review and prioritize existing translation models that can be useful in guiding the PRC's translation work including a model developed by CDC and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors\n\n-  Develop and promote examples of translation model elements in action\n\n-  Develop, refine, and share research and practice tools that can be used to enhance dissemination and implementation of PRC evidence-based interventions (EBls).\n\n-  Participate in the development of a dissemination and implementation toolkit will include: 1) a list of existing translation models from the literature, 2) guidance, such as \"how to\" instructions and / or reflection prompts to support decision making, 3) and tools (such as planning templates, communication templates, practitioner distribution lists, partnership tracking tools, etc.) to advance dissemination and translation of PRC EBIs.\n\n-  Serve as a resource and support the CDC PRC Program by providing dissemination, translation, and implementation subject expertise in programmatic decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 7, 2023.** Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\n\n\n**Appointment Length:** The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of CDC and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\n\n\n**Level of Participation:** The appointment is full-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Citizenship Requirements:** This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\n\n\n**ORISE Information:** This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and CDC. Participants do not become employees of CDC, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\n\n\nThe successful applicant(s) will be required to comply with Environmental, Safety and Health (ES&H) requirements of the hosting facility, including but not limited to, COVID-19 requirements (e.g. facial covering, physical distancing, testing, vaccination). Additionally, the fellow will follow the telework schedule based on guidance and recommendations applicable to all Division staff.\"",

        "title": "\"Grand Opportunity in Medications Development for Substance-Use Disorders (U01 Clinical Trial Optional)\"",
        "description": "\"Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-22-202  \n**Background**\n\n\n\nThe development of safe and effective medications for the treatment of SUDs is a public health priority. Currently, there are medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of nicotine and opiate dependence. However, none of these medications provides the optimal therapy. Moreover, there are no FDA approved medications for cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis use disorders. Thus, the development of safe and effective medications to treat these disorders is an urgent public health need. Improving the outcome of treatments for SUDs with medications can have vast public health implications.\n\n\n\nScientific advances are offering extraordinary opportunities for the development of medications to treat SUDs. These include the discovery of genes and proteins, receptors, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and brain circuits associated with drug abuse, as well as risk and protective factors for the onset and progression of these disorders, and the development of new small and large molecules such as vaccines. Multiple therapeutic approaches, ranging from small molecules to biologics (e.g., vaccines) are ready for the next step in the FDA approval process, and concerted efforts are needed to advance these potential pharmacotherapies to approval. It is likely that effective pharmacotherapies for SUDs will produce immediate reductions in the rates of drug use as well as on its medical and psychosocial consequences.\n\n\n\n**Research Objectives**\n\n\n\nApplications should focus on the development of compounds for the treatment of SUDs including opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, nicotine, cannabis or any other illicit substance. It can include the evaluation of: 1) new chemical entities (NCEs), 2) already-marketed medications, 3) biologics (i.e., vaccines, antibodies, enzymes, gene therapies, etc.), 4) combinations of medications, and/or 5) new delivery devices/technologies.\n\n\n\nThe medications investigated for SUDs may target one or more of the neuropathological mechanisms, the various clinical stages, and/or the medical/psychiatric complications of one or multiple SUDs.\n\n\n\nResearch is encouraged, but not limited, to studies in the following areas:\n\n\n\nApplications should provide the entry and exit points of the proposed research in the FDA approval pathway.\n\n\n\nApplications are expected to involve individuals seeking treatment including behavioral therapy. However, the scope of this FOA does not include the evaluation of the safety and/or efficacy of psychosocial interventions.\n\n\n\nAwardees are also expected to make their individual datasets and aggregated datasets available for data sharing to other investigators when appropriate.\n\n\n\nNIDA Program Officials will be substantially involved in the scientific direction of the award in a partnership role. The NIDA Program Scientists will collaborate on developing common measures, procedures and data management protocols, monitor study progress, insure disclosure of conflicts of interest and adherence to NIDA and NIH policies, and participate in data analysis and manuscript preparation as appropriate.\n\n\n\n1.      \n\n    -  Chemistry and Pharmaceutics: lead compound optimization, creation/expansion of small molecular libraries, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, formulation or drug-delivery technology, prodrug, proteinaceous (e.g., vaccines and antibodies), and/or bioassay development of potential medications for SUDs\n\n    -  Preclinical Development: drug interaction studies between medications and drugs of abuse and evaluation of safety and/or efficacy in established animal models, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of potential pharmacotherapies for SUDs\n\n    -  Clinical Development: Phase I - Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, dose-ranging, and/or initial efficacy in human subjects. Phase II - Proof-of-concept, pilot studies, safety and efficacy testing in a larger sample of human subjects. Phase III - Safety and efficacy of medications tested in a large sample of patients\n\n\n\nIt is expected that these U01s will be short-term (funded for up to 3 years) and large (up to $5 million per year) cooperative agreements with close monitoring and significant scientific involvement of NIDA staff.\n\n\n\n**Special Considerations**\n\n\n\nNational Advisory Council on Drug Abuse Recommended Guidelines for the Administration of Drugs to Human Subjects:\n\n\n\nThe National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential, and dependence or addiction liability, to human subjects. Potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of Council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects. The guidelines are available on NIDA's Web site at [http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical-research/nacda-guidelines-administration-drugs-to-human-subjects](http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical-research/nacda-guidelines-administration-drugs-to-human-subjects).\n\n\n\nPoints to Consider Regarding Tobacco Industry Funding of NIDA Applicants:\n\n\n\nThe National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) encourages NIDA and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on NIDA's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. Please see ([http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/council-statements/points-to-consider-regarding-](http://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/council-statements/points-to-consider-regarding-)) for details.\n\n\n\nData Harmonization for Substance Abuse and Addiction via the PhenX Toolkit:\n\n\n\nNIDA strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the Core and Specialty collections, which are available in the Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). Please see NOT-DA-12-008 ([https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-12-008.html](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-12-008.html)) for further details.\n\n\n\n**Data sharing:**\n\n\n\nNIDA strongly encourages investigators to share data with other investigators. NIDA expects that applicants to NIDA funding opportunity announcements: 1) submit their data to one of the NIH data archives for sharing; 2) include specific required elements in the Resource Sharing Plan including a description of whether and how the consents that will be used to obtain that data will affect the research that can be done with that data; and 3) include costs attributed to data preparation and submission to a data archive in grant applications. \n\n\n\nPlan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP):\n\n\n\nNIH supports the formation of research teams that represent diverse perspectives, backgrounds and academic and technical disciplines (see [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html) and [NOT-OD-22-019](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-019.html)), as well as the submission of research applications from all eligible institutions. In accordance with the NIDA REI Initiative, applications to this FOA should reflect the full diversity of potential applicants and applicant institutions. Applications from researchers with diverse backgrounds underrepresented across roles and positions in research, including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, persons with disabilities, and women are strongly encouraged to apply to this Funding Opportunity Announcement.\n\n\n\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\n\n\n\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the [Research Methods Resources](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/) website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\"",

Do not wait to start this process.\n\nWARNING: BY THE DEADLINE FOR THIS NOFO YOU MUST HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION:   The applicant organization MUST be registered in NIH s eRA Commons; AND\n\nThe Project Director MUST have an active eRA Commons account (with the PI role) affiliated with the organization in eRA Commons.\n\nNo exceptions will be made.\n\nApplicants also must register with the System for Award Management (SAM) and Grants.gov (see Appendix A of this NOFO for all registration requirements).\n\nDO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO SUBMIT THE APPLICATION. If you wait until the last minute, there is a strong possibility that the application will not be received without errors by the deadline.\n\n\n\n**System of Care Approach**\n\nThe CMHI program s activities are formulated based on the SOC approach. SOC is defined as a comprehensive spectrum of mental health and essential support services organized into a coordinated network to address and meet the varied needs of children, youth, and young adults at risk for or with SED, their families, and their caregivers\n\nThe aim of CMHI is to advance progress in developing a comprehensive SOC by concentrating on sustainable financing, cross-agency collaboration, the formation of policy and infrastructure, and the development and implementation of evidence-based and evidence-informed services and supports. This concentrated approach is necessary to ensure that children, youth, and young adults at risk for or with SED, and their families, receive effective services within their communities, and that providers collaborate to coordinate care in a family-friendly and culturally responsive manner.4 SAMHSA encourages recipients to address disparity of services among underserved and minority populations.5 The SOC approach has improved mental, social, and emotional outcomes for children, youth, and young adults, enhanced family outcomes, and expanded the availability of effective evidence-based interventions.\n\nThe population of focus is children and youth, from birth through age 21, at risk for or with serious emotional disturbance SED, and their families.\n\nThe Grants for Expansion and Sustainability of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children with Serious Emotional Disturbances program is authorized under Sections 561-565 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended\"",

        "title": "\"Science And Application Opportunities For A Dual-Frequency Ku-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Concept - Call For Ideas\"",
        "description": "\"**A dual Ku-band synthetic aperture radar concept dedicated to measuring terrestrial snow mass**\nThe Canadian Space Agency (CSA) completed the Phase 0 development for a moderate-resolution, dual-frequency Ku-band (13.5; 17.25 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite concept. The initiative responds to a need identified by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) to increase Canada's capability to monitor snow water equivalent (SWE) over the Northern Hemisphere. The primary mission objective is to quantify the spatially and temporally dynamic amount of freshwater stored in seasonal terrestrial snow (the SWE); through data assimilation, improve the treatment of snow in operational environmental prediction systems and thereby enhance numerical weather prediction, hydrological forecasting, and seasonal prediction.\n\n\n\n**Motivation for a Call for Ideas**\n\n\n\nShould this dual Ku-band SAR concept be fully realized, the CSA would be interested in maximizing the science and socio-economical return on this mission. Notably, the SAR frequencies are a novel element of the mission that no other satellites historically or currently provide, which may enable new opportunities including the primary mission objectives. As such, the CSA would be interested in capturing the interest from the Canadian scientific community to pursue pre- and post-launch research investigations, including data validation activities, and innovative satellite data solutions development to help meet various needs in our everyday lives.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of Reconciliation and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and in recognition of the value and importance of the science, technology and ways of knowing of Indigenous Peoples, the CSA is interested in hearing from Indigenous Peoples, who may wish to contribute Indigenous science or traditional knowledge through this Call for Ideas.\n\n\n\n**Type of responses**\n\nThe CSA foresees four types of responses (or combinations thereof) to this Call for Ideas (responses provided should take into account the specifications provided in the [Appendix A](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/funding-programs/funding-opportunities/ao/2024-ku-band-sar-concept-cfi.asp#appendix-a)):\n\n\n\n1.  Additional science validation of primary mission algorithms and products:\n\n    Examples of potential needs for investment could include leveraging existing infrastructure and models to collect new data, perform additional analyses or refine models and algorithms to support the validation of the SWE, snow wet/dry state, and/or snow microstructure variables retrieved from dual Ku-band SAR data over a range of conditions and environments.\n\n    \n\n2.  Additional variables retrieved from the concept as currently scoped: \n\n    Examples of potential needs for investments could include the retrieval of additional geophysical variables beyond the retrieval of snow-related variables, including validation activities. These activities could rely solely on data provided by the concept or also leverage other sources of data (in situ, airborne or satellite sensors).\n\n    \n\n3.  Development of innovative applications towards ready-to-use products and services:\n\n    Examples of potential needs for investments could include the development of new applications, data products, models/prototypes, methodologies, teaching/learning methods and tools, education material, systems, services, etc. resulting from dual Ku-band SAR data to meet today's challenges resulting in a better future for all.\n\n    \n\n4.  Suggested names for the concept as a future satellite mission\"",
